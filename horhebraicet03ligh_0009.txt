ΤΟ THE

MOST REVEREND FATHER IN CHRIST,

GILBERT,

BY DIVINE PROVIDENCE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY‚

PRIMATE OF ALL ENGLAND, &e

MAY 1T PLEASE YOUR Grmcn,

HAVING at length finished (in such a manner as it is) this un-
dertaking of mine upon the four Evangelists‚ religion, gratitude, and
duty require it from me, to commemorate and reeognise the infinite
merey of God towards me in bringing me thus far, continuing my
life, preserving to me that strength of eyesight, vigour both of body
and mind, to and in so great a degree of old age. To all which the
same divine meroy hath added this great benefit‚—that it hath in-
dulged me your Graee's eompassi0n‚ favour, and patr-onage. This
hath not a little sweetened all the rest, securing to me so much
leisure for books, tranquillity in my studies, the settlement of my
family, and an easy condition of life. Without this, my mind, bent
towards studies, must have wanted its opportunities : Ι must have
been to seek for leisure, retirement, and a quiet seat. The blossom-
ings of these my labours (if now there be any thing in them that
is valuable) must have withered in their first putting out, if, by
the Divine favour, the dew of your Grace's favour had not watered
them.

Your Grace may have forgotten (for you are not wont to write
your good turns in marble) what great things you did for me in
my straits: what kindness and good will I then found from you,
what industry of doing me good, even to admiration. However‚

they must never slip out of my remembrance and aeknowledgment
