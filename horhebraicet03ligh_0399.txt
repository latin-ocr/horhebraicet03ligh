their way of leaning at meals, discourse amongst themselves,
,ἼἹΠῺ ,7³³7 ἾῖΠὉ they talked by signs either with their hands
or upon their fingers.

We must not omit what the Grloss said, that they were
wont to sit at table leaning on their left side, with their “feet
upon the ground;'' this is to be understood when one sat
alone, or two at the table only. And the Gemara tells us,
that the order was otherwise when but two sat down: for
then he that was the second sat below him that was the chief,
and not at his pillow.

There was also a diversity of tables: for the ordinary table
of the Pharisee, or one of the disciples of the wise men, was
but little, where three at most could sit down 3 and there were
tables which would hold more. Ι

The ordinary table is described in Bam Bathrac .· “ What
kind of table is that of the disciples of the wise men?

Gloss: “ They were wont to put a ring upon the edge of the
table to hang it by.” That hanging up the table when they
had done using it, seems to have been only to set it out of
danger of contracting any defilement3 and argues it was but
small and light. Now the ring of the table was ab extra, when
that part of the table where the ring was was naked, not
covered with a tablecloth: so that it was not amongst the
guests, but without, viz. in that void place where nobody sat
down. We have more in the same place about the ring being
placed within or without. Gloss: “ If a child sit at table with
his father, the ring was without, not among the guests‚ lest
the child, playing with the ring, should shake the table.''
eemara: mmm svb-1 sn symm μνᾶ-τ sn. If a
servant be waiting at the table, then the table is so placed
(especially if it be night), that the ring is within, lest the
servant, in moving to and fro, should happen to touch
upon it.
