four kinds of death” [which were wont to be inflicted by the
Sanhedrim] “did not cease. For he that had deserved to
be stoned to death, he either fell off from some house, or some
wild beast tore and devoured him. He that had deserved
buming, he either fell into some fire or some serpent bit him.
He that had deserved to be slain'' [i. 6. with the sword]‚
“ was either delivered into the hands of a heathen king, or
was murdered by robbers. He that had deserved strangling
was either drowned in some river, or choked by a squinancy
[anyz‘na] .'' ο

But it may be objected, Why is it said, ‘⁶ From the time
that the Temple was destroyed,'' and not, “ Forty years before
the destruction of the Temple 3³³ To this the Gloss answereth :
“ Sometimes, according to the urgency and necessity of the
time, the Sanhedrim returned to the room Gazitlc,'' &a It
is further excepted *nr-r ΝΒ rui-1⁸35: mmm ηψπ mmm
ΞῙἊὩῙῚ ΓἾῚἹΠ “ But they never returned to sit in capital
causes, or to try murder-s, For the reason of their removal
at first was because the numbers of homicides so increased
upon them,'’ διο.

V. When the great council did not sit in Gazith, all courts
for capital matters ceased everywhere else. One Gloss saith
thus : “ They took no cognizance of capital matters „in any of
the lesser sessions, so long as the great Sanhedrim did not sit
in the room Gazith.'’ Another saith3 “What time the great
Sanhedrim sat in its proper place, where it ought, near the
altar, then thou shalt make thee judges in all thy gates to
judge in capital causes: but when that removed, then all cog-
nizance about those matters ceased.”

VI. The Sanhedrim removed, as we have already seen, from
Gazitk, forty years before Jerusalem was destroyed : and this
is the very thing that was said, ‘⁴ Forty years before the de-
struction of the city, judgment in capital causes was taken
awa'y from thems’ And now let the reader judge what should
be the reason of their being deprived of this privilege: whether
the Romans were in fault; or whether rather the Jews, nay,
the Sanhedrim it-self, had not brought it upon themselves,
When the Sanhedrim flitted from Gazitla .· all judgment of this
kind vanished‚ and upon what reasons they did thus flit we
have learned from their own pons.
