It is added in another evangelist, “ Be m ye wise as serpents,”
&az with which we may compare that in Illidraslz Sclmn ,-
“The holy blessed God saith concerning Israel ΞΠ ἿῙἍΞΝ
ΕἿΞἾΌ ΞἾῺᾙΞΠ those that belong] to me are simple as doces,
&wrm U'U'ffiy ΞΠ ''u-TN: ¹72& but amonqst the viations qs*
the world, they aro subtle as serpents.”

Ver. 4: Μηδένα κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ἀσπάσησθε· Salute πο mom by
the way] Ι. We have a passage something like this else-
where03 ‘⁶ If thou meet any man, salute him not ;'' that is (as
is commonly expounded), do not hindei· thy journey by dis-
coursing with any in the way. But the same reason doth
not hold in this place; the business of these disciples not
requiring such mighty expedition. They were commanded
out two by two, to this or the other place or city where Christ
himself was to come in person; nor was it necessary they
should run in so great haste, that they should make no stay
in the way. Only having appointed them to such and such
places, their business indeed lay nowhere but in those very
places to which they had been particularly sent, to proclaim
the coming of Christ there, and not to be telling it in the
way. The twelve apostles that were sent, their business was
to declare the coming of the ‘ kingdom of heaven 3⁷ these the
coming of the ‘ King himself? No wonder, therefore, if the
apostles were not forbidden to salute any in the way; for
their province waS, wherever they came, to tell the world
that the kingdom of heaven was come: but these were only
to give notice that the Messiah was coming: and that in
those places only to which he was to come, and not to any
whom they should meet cursor-ily in the way.

II. It was a very usual thing in that nation, upon some
accounts, not to salute any in the way, nc, not any person at
all. “ Hep that is mourning for the dead, let him not salute
any person for the first seven days of his mourning.'⁷ If
thirteenq fasts had been celebrated by order of the Sanhe-
drim for the imploring of rain, and yet no rain had fallen,
then they “ diniinish from their business, and from building,
and from plant-ing, and from espousals and marriage, ΠῘῬΝΨἎἾ
