in the eyes of the Lordg is the death of his saints ¹¹.' Ben
Zumah 92:235 ΥἛΠ look-ed with some curiosity about him, and
ke was distarbed in his intellectuals: of him the Scripture
speaketh, ‘ Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is suffi-
cient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.' ’²

Araela, reciting these words, saith, “121 ΓἾΞΞΠΞ ΒἻἾΞ 'is-72³]
ΓΠ) It is called paradise, ander the siym'fieation of the grarden
ofEden, which is reserved for the just. This place is ΠὉἾΏΞ
in the lzeavens, where the souls of the just are gathered toge-
ther.” And the Talmudical Gloss hath it much to the same
sense: “ These four, by God's procurement, 9375& ‘¹379 went
up into thefirmament.”

While we are reading these passages, that story may easily
occur to mind of St. Paul's being “ caught up into pa7·aclise,”
2 Cor. xii3 and perhaps the legend before us is but the ape
of that story. In the story it is observable, that paradise
and the ‘ third heaven’ are one and the same thing: in the
legend paradise and ,ΠἮἾὩ the kiykest heavens. For so
the doctors comment upon the word in Psalm lxviii. 5:
‘³ Therei are seven classes or degrees of just persons, who
see the face of God, sit in the house of God, ascend up unto
the hill of God, &a And to every class or degree there is
allotted their proper dwellingplace 3737 μὶ in paradise.
There are also seven abiding places in hell. Those that
dwell in paradise, ΏῬἾΠ ἾΐἼἸῖΒ ἹἻἾΠῬ they sleine like tlte
skininy of the firmament, like the sun, like the moon, like the
firmament, like the stars, like lightning, like the lilies, like
burning lamps ΙΨ

ΙΙ. Our Saviour, therefore, telling the penitent thief, This
day skalt thou be wala me in paradise, he speaks in the ,conl-
mon dialect, and to the capacity of the thies ; viZ., that he
should be in heaven with Christ, and with all just persons
that had left this world. Nor, indeed, would I fetch the
explication of ‘that article of our creed, Κατῆλθευ εἰς ἅδου,
He descended into hell, from any passage in the Scripture
sooner than this here: adding this, that we must of neces-
sity have recourse to the Greek tongue for the signification
of the word ἅδης, which they generally use to denote tlce state*
