Our countryman Biddulphs describes the way which he
himself travelled from Galilee to Jerusalem, anno Dom. 1601:
out of whom, for the reader’s sake, I will borrow a few pas-
sages. He tells us, that on March 24 they rode near the sea
of Galilee, and gives the computation of that sea to be in
length about eight leagues and in breadth five. Now a
league is three miles. After they had gone about seven
miles, having the sea of Galilee on their left hands, they went
