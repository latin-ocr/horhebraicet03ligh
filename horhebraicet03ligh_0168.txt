162 Hebrew ancl Tabmudical [Ch. xvi. 9,

IV. It is a continued discourse in this place with that in
the foregoing chapter, only that he does more particularly
apply himself to his disciples, ver. Ι,”Ελεγε δὲ καὶ πρὸς τοὺς
μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ, He said anto his discipleffl where the particle
καὶ, and, joins what is discoursed here with what went before.
Now who were his disciples? not the twelve apostles only, nor
the severity disciples only: but πάντες οἱ τελῶναι καὶ οἱ ἆμαρ-
τωλοὶ, chap. xv. 1, all the publicans and sinners that came to
hear him. For we needs must suppose them in the number
of disciples‚ if we consider the distinction of the congregation
then present, being made between scribes and Pharisees, and
those that came to him with a good mind to hear: besides
that we may observe how Christ entertains them, converseth
with them, and pleads for them in the parable of the fore-
going chapter. Which plea and apology for them against
the scribes and Pharisees being finished, he turns his dis-
course to them themselves, and under the parable of an
Unjust Steward, instructs them how they may make to them-
selves friends of the wealth they had unjustly gained, as he
had done. And, indeed, what could have been more sea-
sonably urged before the unjust and covetous Pharisees, than
to stir up his followers, that, if they had acquired any un-
righteous gains before their conversion, they would now
honestly restore thern, piously distribute them, that so they
may make themselves friends of them, as the Unjust Steward
had done?

And for a comment upon this doctrine, let us take the
instance of Zacehaeus, chap. xix. If Christ, while entertained
in his house, had said to him what he said to his disciples
here, “Zacchaeus, make to thyself friends of the mammon of
unriylzteousness; would Zacchaeus himself, or those that stood
by, have understood him any otherwise, than that he should
make friends to himself of that wealth he had gotten dis-
honestly? And why they may not be so understood here, I
profess I know not; especially when he discourses amongst
those disciples that had been publicans and sinners3 and
scarce any of them, for aught we knOW, but before his eon-
version had been unjust and unrighteous enough.
