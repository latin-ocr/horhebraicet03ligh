upon Matt. xxvii. 9: and let not the reader think it irksome
to repeat it here.

“ Whereasa the Book of Kings ends in destruction, and
the whole Book of J eremiah treats about destruction3
whereas Ezekiel begins with destruction, and ends in con-
solation ; and whereas Isaiah is all in consolation, they
joined destruction with destruction, and consolation with
consolation.''

III. The third division of the Bible is entitled⁹D⁸mDD
the Holy lVrz’tinqs. And here also is found an Octateuoh by
somebody (as it seems), though I know not where to find it.

“Herbanus the J ew b ἦν γὰρ αὐτὸς ἄκρα πεπαιδευμένος τόν τε υό-
μου, καὶ τὰς τῶν Προφητῶυ θείας δέλτους, τήν τε ὀκτάτευχον καὶ τὰ

law and the propliet8‚ and indeed what the τὰ ,περίλοιπα, all
the other writinys besides should be, is not easily guessed. This
Octccteuclb perhaps may seem to have some reference to the
0³:515: Hayioyraplwc‚ or Holy Writinqs: for it is probable
enough that, speaking of a Jew well skilled in the Holy
Scriptums, he might design the partition of the Bible accord-
ing to the manner of the J ews⁵ dividing it: but who then can
pick out books that should make it up? Let the reader pick
out the eight; and then I would say, that the other four are
the τὰ περίλοιπα, all the otker writinys. But we will not much
disquiet ourselves about this matter.

It may be asked, why these books should be called ΠἾΞἸΓὉ
tlte ιδ’ωἱρίῑωες, when the whole Bible goes under the name of
ΨἺΡΠ ἾΞΠΞ the Holy Scripturas. Nor can any thing be more
readily answered to this, than that by this title they would
keep up their dignity and just esteem for them. They did
not indeed read them in their synagogues, but that they
might acknowledge them of most holy and divine authority,

the same title with the rest of the Holy Scriptures.
