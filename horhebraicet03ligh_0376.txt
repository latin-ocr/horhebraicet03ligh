of the stem of J esse.' ”

If, therefore, the Sanhedrim suspected Jesus to be the
Messiah, they might, by the sanie reason, from thence also
gather that the destruction of the city and nation was not
far off 3 especially when they see the people falling off from
J udaism to the religion of J esus.

ΙΙΙ. The fathers of the Sanhedrim judge that the nation
would contract hereby an unspeakable deal of gusst, such as
would subJect them to all those curses mentioned Deut. xxviii ;
particularly that their turning off from J udaism would issue in
the final overthrow of the whole nation; and if their religion
should be deserted, neither the city nor the commonwealth

could possibly survive it long. So rooted was the love and
value they had for their wretched traditions.

Let us therefore frame their words into this paraphrase:
“ It does seem that this man can be no other than the true

than that our whole nation should perish under the arms and
fury of the Romans 3”

than the whole nation should perish‚' &c.

the prophets3 There had not been a prophet among the chief
priests, the priests, the people, for these four hundred years
and more 3 and does Gaiaphas now begin to prophesy? It is a
very foreign fetch that some would make, when they would
ascribe this gift to the office he then bore, as if by being made
high priest he became a prophet. The opinion is not worth
confuting. The evangelist himself renders the reason when

he tells us ἀρχιερεὺς ὢν ἐνιαυτοῦ ἐκείνου, being] hiqh prz‘est that
