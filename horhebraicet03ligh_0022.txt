declares the number3 e. g, there is, it may be, the number
one hundred, or threescore, according to the multitude of
the priests standing round. He begins to reckon from the
person whose cap he snatched off, and numbers round till

number terminates‚ he obtains that office about which the
lot was concerned. And so it is in all the lots.''

I will not inquire at present whether this casting of lots
