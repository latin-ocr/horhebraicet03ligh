Alexandria of Egypt; and there building an altar, offered
idolatrous sacrifices upon it. These are the words of Meir:
but R. Judah tells him the thing was not so: for Onias did
not own his brother Shimei to be two years and a half older
than himself; but envying him, told him, ⁶ Come, and I will
teach thee the rule and method of thy ministry.' ’³ And so,
as R. -Judah relates the matter, the tables are turned, the
whole scene altered3 so that Onias persuades his brother
Shimei to put 011 his wife’s stomacher, and gird himself with
her girdle3 and for that reason the priests do plot the death
of Shimei. “But when he had declared the whole matter
as it was indeed, then they desigued to kill Onias. He there-
fore flying into Alexandria in Egypt, builds there an altar,
and offered sacrifices upon it to the name of the Lord, ac—

mount u'pon which the blessiugs had been pronounced. Let
the Jews speak for themselves, whether they believed that
Onias, with pure regard to that-,a propheey, did build his
Temple 111 Egypt; and let every wise man laugh at those
that do thus persuade themselves. However, this is certain,
they had universally much more favourable thoughts of that
in Egypt than of this upon mount Gerizim. Hence that pas-
sage in the place before quoted: ‘⁴ If any one say, ‘ Ι devote
a whole burnt 0131611118,Ἷ let him offer it in the Temple at Jeru-
salem; for if he offer it in the Temple of Onias, he doth not
perform his vow. But if any one say, ‘I devote a whole
burnt offering for the Temple of Ouiae, though he ought to
offer itin the Temple at Jerusalem, yet if he offer it in the
Temple of Onias, he aequits himself? R. Simeon saith, It
is 110 but-nt offering. Moreover, if any one shall say, ‘l vow
myself to be a Naza1·ite,' let him shave himself in the Temple
at Jerusalem ; for if he be shaven in the Temple of Onia-s, he
