Ch. xii. 2.] Exercitations upon St. Jolm. 373

Thus miserably are the great masters of wisdom deceived
in almost all their surmises3 they expect the gathering to-
gether of the children of God in one by the life of the
Messiah, which was to be accomplished by his death. They
believe their traditional religion was the establishment of that
nation3 whereas it became its overthrow. They think to
secure themselves by the death of Christ, when by that very
death of his their expected security was chiefly shaken. Ο

Ver. 55 : Ἵνα ἁγνίσωσιν ἑαυτούς· To purvffy themselves] “ R.

Isaacm saith, ³725: ’173237 n& WWZDS [ΠΝ ΞὛἾΠ Every mem
is bound το purif‘es himself for tlte feast.” Now there were
several measures of time for purifying. He that was unclean
by the touch of a dead body required a whole week’s time,
that he might be sprinkled with the water of purification
mixed with the ashes of the red heifer, burnt the third and
the seventh days: which ceremony we may see and laugh at
in Paralt, cap. 3. ,

Other purifyings were speedilier performed : amongst
others, shaving themselves and washing their garments were
accounted necessary, and within the laws of purifying.
“ Thesen shave themselves within the feast: he who cometh
from a heathen country, or from captivity‚ or from prison.
Also he who hath been excommunicated, but now absolved
by the wise men. These same also wash their garments.
within the feast.’'

It is supposed that these were detained by some necessity
of affairs, that they could not wash and be shaved before the
feast ; for these things were of right to be performed before,
lest any should, by any means, approach polluted unto the
celebration of this feast3 but if, by some necessity, they were
hindered from doing it before, then it was done *mm ³712> ³³7er:
on a common day of the fhast, viZ. after the first day of the
feast.
