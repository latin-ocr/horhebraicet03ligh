goes on, his disciples following him wondering, and fearing
the effects of it, Mark x. 32. He mentioned only at present
his journey into J udea, t00 see Lazarus: but, as they were
going, he foretells his progress to Jerusalem, and what was
to be done with him there. It is probable he was at Beth-
abarah when the message came to him that Lazarus was

VER, 2 : Ζακχαῖος· Zacchaeus] There is mention of one of
the same name, Zacchaz’, a father of a famous family, Ezra
ii. 9 : and about the time wherein our Zacchaeus lived, there
was one Ζασσῖιαῖ, the father of Rabban J ochanan; than whom
there was hardly a more noted Rabban in the whole cata-

that nation, it is hardly eredible that that should consist with
the degree of Rabbin. To which Ι may add, that that Zac-

II. We may judge from the character of that Zaeckai‚
whether he did not live and die a J ew as to his religion, in
every punctilio of it. “ R. Zacchai'sq disciples asked him”
(where note, he bears the title of Rabbi), ‘⁶ How dost thou
attain to old age? He answered them, ‘I did never in my
whole life make water within four cubits of the place of
prayer: I never miscalled my neighbour: I never let slip
