highly it eonduoed to the ylory of God, would be needless to
shew: and how it introduced peace on the earth the apostle
himself shews from the effect, Eph. ii. 143 Col. i. 203 and se·
veral other places.

Ver. 213 Καὶ ὅτε ἐπλήσθησαν ἡμέραι ὀκτὼ τοῦ περιτεμεῖν, She.
And when eiqlzt days were acoomplislzed for tlze circumcision of
the child] “Theb disciples of R. Simeon Ben ‚Joohai asked
him, Why the law ordained circumcision on the eiylztlc day?
To wit, lest while all others were rejoicing‚ the parents of the
infant should be sad. The oiroumoision therefore is deferred
till the woman in ohildbed hath got over her uneleanness.''
For, as it is expressed a little before, ‘⁶ The woman that
brings forth a, man-child is prohibited her husband the space
of seven days, but on the seventh day, at the coming in of the
evening which begins the eighth day, ,4791ss numm 3472th
she waslzeth herself, ami is allowed to 90 in unco her husband.''
If she came nigh him within the seven days she made him

himself to make provision for his wife, and to take care about
the eiroulnoision of the child.

'‘R. Asai saithc, ΠἾἿῘὮ nmmo 'mh-w) ³7: the child whose
mother is unclean bg] childbearz'ozy is circumcised the eighth
day3 buthe whose mother is not unolean by ehildbearing is
not oirouxnoised the eighth day.’'

You will ask probably, what mother that is, that is not
unelean by childbearing. Let the Gloss upon this plaoe make
the answer: “ She whose child is eut out of her womb: as
also a Gentile woman who is brought to bed to-day, and the
next day becomes a proselyte3 her child is not desei-red till
the eighth day, but is circumcised straightway.” And the
Rabbins a little after: “One takes a handmaid big with
child, and while she is with him brings forth, her child is oir-
oumcised the eighth day. But if he takes a serving-maid‚
and with her a child newly born, that child is oiroumoised the
first day.”

Theyd did not account a heathen woman unelean by child-
