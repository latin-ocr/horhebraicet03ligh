446 Hebrew and Talmudz'cal [Oh. xx. 23. ’

it was necessary they should be backed and encouraged by a
peculiar authority: which if we find not in this clause,
“Whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained‚’' where
should we look for it? And therefore, when he endows his
apostles with a power which he never thought fit to exercise
in his own person, no wonder if he does it by a singular and
unusual action ς and that was ‘ breathingupon them,q ver. 22.

But. we must know, that whereas, amongst other mighty
powers conferred, we reckon that as one, viz. ‘ delivering over
unto Satan‚' we are far from meaning nothing else by it but
‘excommunication.' What the Jews themselves meant by
that kind of phrase, let us see by one instance:

rin‘vff rme *nup-r nrt-1 Nun: *mn irum “Those
two men of Cush that stood before Solomon, Elihoreph and Ahijah
the scribeS, sons of Shausha. On a certain day Solomon saw
the angel of death weeping: he said, ‘ Why weepest thou 3⁹
He answered‚ &nrt *nn-’ff amn: ἾἾἾΠ ἾΠ *bun ³927 ΝῙῺἿ
‘ Because these two Ouskites entreat me that they may continue kere)
Solomon ἾἾΏΨῘῬ immor: delivered them over to the davil, who
brought them to the borders of Luz3 and when they were
come to the borders of Luz they died.''

Gloss: “ He calls them Cushites [irom'cally], because they
were very beautiful. They ‘ entreat me that they might con-
tinue here.’ For the time of their death was now come: but
the angel of death could not take their souls away, because it
had been decreed that they should not die but at the gates
of Luz. Solonion therefore delivered them over ΒἾἻΨῖ) to the
devils ; for he reigned over the devils, as it is written, ‘ And
solomon sat upon the throne of the Lord, for he reigned

ancl those tkinys that are below? '’

J osephus also makes mention of the power that Solomon
had over the devilsf'. Παρέσχε δ’ αὐτῷ μαθεῖν ὁ Θεὸς, καὶ τὴν
κατὰ τῶν δαιμόνων τέχνην· God tau-ql& kim an art ayainst
demons. The belief ὓ of either of these stories is at the liberty
of the reader. Only from the former we may make this ob-
servation, Thata power of ‘delivering over to Satan' was,
even in the Jews' opinion, divine and miraculous. We ac-
knowledge this to have been in the apostleS, and in the apo-
