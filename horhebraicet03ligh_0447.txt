need of such mighty asseverations for that. Questionless,
therefore, he would intimate something else, viz. that you
may believe that this is the true blood of the new covenant,
which so directly answers the type in the confirmation of the

Ver. 36 ε Ὀστοῦν οὐ συντριβήσεται αὐτοῦ· A bone ofhim shall

I. It is no unusual thing for the Greek interpreters in their
renderings sometimes to favour the J ewish traditions, and
sometimes the common interpretation of the nation. There

do with at this time; wherein take one 01· two exampleS‚ in-
stead of many that might be reckoned up.

What reason can be given that they should render
