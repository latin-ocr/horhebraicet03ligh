judged to deathm.” I admire how this learned man should
deliver these things with so much confidence‚ as even to
chastise -Josephus himself for his mistake in his computation
of the time for this story, concluding thus 3 ‘⁸ When, indeed,
this slaugliter‚ made upon the Samaritans by Pilato, seems to
be that very slaughter of the Galileans mentioned by St.Luke‚
chap. xiii. 1.”

WVhereas‚ in truth, Josephus mentions not one syllable
either of Galilee or sacrifice, 01· the Galileans‚ but Samaritam.-
and it is a somewhat bold thing to substitute rebelliny
Samaritano* in the place of scccmfloz‘ngl Galileans. Nor is it
probable that those that tell this matter to our Saviour
would put this gloss and colour upon the thing while they
related it.

III. The feud and enmity that was between Pilate and
Herod¹¹ might· be enough to incense Pilate to make this
havock of the subjects of Herod.

‘⁸ Davidss swore to Abishffl, As the Lord livcth, if thou touch
the blood of this righteous man [Saul]‚ '17:72 ἾὮἾ zum ’ΠΝ
Ι will miezgyle thy blood with his blood.” So Pilate mingled the
blood of these sacrificers with the blood of those sacrifices
they had slain. lt is remarkable that in Εἰρήνα Ρ, “ the kill-
ing of the sacrifices mmmmm ΞἾἾΞὨΞ Dum: 0³53: ΠἾἾΒ)
may be well euouyh done by &magster-3, by women, by servants, by
the maclam,- even those sacrifices that are most holy, provided
that the unclean touch not the flesh of them.” And a little
after 3 “At the sprinkling of the blood, the work of the priest
begins3 and the slaying of them may be done by any hand
whatever.”

Hence was it a very usual thing for those that brought
the sacrifice to kill it themselves3 and so, probably, these
miserable Galileans were slaughtered‚ while they themselves
were slaying their own sacrifices. For it is more likely that
they were slain in the Temple while they were offering their
sacrifices, than in the way, while they were bringing them
thither.
