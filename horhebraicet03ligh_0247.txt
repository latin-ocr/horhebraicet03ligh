Ch. i. ¹4] Emercitatious upon St. Jolm. 241

I. Οὐκ ἐξ αἱμάτων, ποτ quloods. Observe the plural num-
ber: “ Our0 Rabbins say, That all Israel had thrown off cir-
cumcision in Egypt but at length they were circumcised,
ribam-x mn rica-v m numni, and ma blood osche pass-
over was otainyled with tlte blood of tlte circumcised, and God
accepted every one of them and kissed them.” “ I saidP,
”U Ἶῖζὶἶζῑ while thou were in thy mods, Live‘i: i. e. in the
twofold blood, that of the passover, and that of the circumci-
sion.” Ther Israelites were brought into covenant by three
things3 by circumcision, by washing, and by offering of sacri-
fices. In the same manner, a heathen‚ if he would be ad-
mitted into covenant, he must of necessity be circumcised,
baptized‚ and offer sacrifices, We see how ἐξ αἱμάτων, of
bloods of the passover and circumcision‚ they say the Israel-

 

ites were recovered from their degeneracy : and how ἐξ αἱμά-
των of the bloods of circumcision and sacrifices (with the addi-
tion only of washing), they supposed the Gentiles might
become the sons of God, being by their proselytism made
Israelites, and the children of the covenant: for they knew
of 110 other adoption or sonship.

II. Ἐκ θελήματος σαρκὸς, Of tlte will of the flesk. In the
same sense wherein the patriarchs and other Jews were am-
bitious by many wives to multiply children of themselves, as
being of the seed of Israel and children of the covenant.

ΙΙΙ. Ἐκ θελήματος ἀνδρὸς, Of the will of man, in that sense
wherein they coveted so many proselytes‚ to admit them into
the religion of the Jews, and so into covenant and sonship with
Grod.

These were the ways by which the Jews thought any be-
came the sons of Grod, that is, by being made Israelites. But
it is far otherwise in the adoption and sonship that accrues to
us by the gospel.

Ver. 14: Δόξαν ὡς μουογευοῧς· The ylory as of the only be—
yotten] This ὣς in this place imports the same thing as wortlms.
We saw his glory as what was worthy or became the only-
begotten Son of God. He did not glister in any worldly pomp
or grandeur according to what the J ewish nation fondly
