Oh. vii. 4, 8.] Ευωυὶΐαίίωιε copon st. John. 313

As to the reason of this mirth and pleasantness, we shall
see more in our notes on ver. 38.

Ver. 4: Ἐν κρυπτῷ δᾉὈΞΞ, in secret: ἐν παρρησίᾳ ΝἿΒΠἾΞΞ,
openly] These brethren of Christ, whoever they were, did
not as yet believe3 because they saw him live so obscure,
and did not behave himself with that pomp and outward
appearance which they expected in the Messiah. And there-
fore they persuade him to go int-o Judea, where he had
baptized most disciples, John iii. 22, that, upon the lustre
of his miracles, he might shine with greater splendour and
majesty.

Ver. 8 ε Ἐγὼ οὔπω ἀναβαίνω εἷς τὴν ἑορτὴν ταύτην· [90 not up
yet unte) this feast] That passage in St. Luke, chap. ix. 51,
“ WVhen the time was come that he should be received up, he
steadfastly set his face to go to ·Jerusalem,'' must have rela-
tion to this story; as will be very evident to any one that will
study the harmony of the gospel3 especially if they observe,
that this evangelist tells us of two journeys after this which
Christ took to Jerusalem, viz. chap. xiii.22, to the feast of the
Dedication3 and chap. xvii. 1 Ι, to the feast of the Passover.
He had absented himself a long time from J uclea, upon the
account of those snares that had been laid for him; but now,
when he had not above six months to live and converse in this
world, he determines resolutely to give all due manifestations
of himself, both in Judea, and wherever else he should happen
to come. And for this cause he sent those seventy disciples
before his face, into every city and place where he himself
would come. Luke x. 1.

When therefore he tells his unbelieving brethren, I 90 nob
up yet, &c.‚ he does not deny that he would go at all, but
only that he would not go yet: partly, because he had no
need of those previous cleansings which they had, if they had
touched any dead body; partly, that he might choose the
most fit season for the manifestation of himself.

But if we take notice how Christ was received into Jeru-
salem five days before the Passover‚ with those very rites and
solemnities that were used at the feast of Tabernacles, viz.
“ with branches of palms‚’' &c. chap. xii, 13, these words may
seem to relate to that time3 and so the word ταύτην might
not denote the individual feast that was now instant, but the
