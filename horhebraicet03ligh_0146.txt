Ver. 11: Πνεῦμα ἔχουσα ἀσθενείας· Havinq a spirit Qf in-
firmity] Ι. The Jews distinguish between spirits, and devils,
and good angel& “Allu thinng do subserve to the glory
of the King os kings, the holy blessed One, ΠἿΠἹἾ ³5³2&

even spirits ΕἺἾΦ ἸέἾΞΝ, also devils nam ’ῢὲἤῖῗὸ ³5⁸2&
also ministeriu-cy a729els.’'

The difficulty is in what sense they take spirits, as they are
distinguished from anyels and devils: when it is probable they
did not mean human souls. But these things are not the
business of this place.

ΙΙ. Therefore, as to this phrase in St. Luke, πνεῦμα ἀσθε-
νείας, α spirit of infirmit-vs, let us begin our inquiry from this
passage: “ Ity is written, ‘ If Ι put the plague of leprosy
in a house of the land of your inheritancez.’ R. J udah saith,
‘ This foretells such plagues to come upon them? R. Simeon
saith, pom& *37:0³7 τΔἾΞ ‘ He excepts those violent plaques that
do not render a man unclean.''' NVhere the Gloss is, D&
'mmm &³77 'UD Γ1ΠἚ3 ''³3) 0⁸92] w: If those playzces come
by tlte insqfflation of the davil, which do not defile the man. And
the eemara a little asten “ Rabba saith, nxz-m *amb ms
He eoecepts the plaffltes of spirits. Rabh Papa saith, ‘He ex-
cepts the plagues of enehantments.’ ” Where the Gloss
again hath it 3 “Those plagues which are inflicted by the
insufflation of the devil, not by the hands of men.''

I. You see, therefore, first, that it was a most received
opinion amongst the Jews, that diseases or plagues might
be inflioted by the devil. Which is plain also from the
evangelists3 because our Saviour, in this very place, tells us,
that the bowiny toyetlzer of this woman was inflieted upon her
by Satan.

2. They conceived further, that some diseases were in-
flieted that were unelean, and some that were not unelean.
The unelean were the leprosy, issues, διας not unelean, were
such as this woman’s infirmity, 850.
