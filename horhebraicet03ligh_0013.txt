so that we may* easily conjecture who are these αὐτόπται
and ὑπηρέται here, viz„ the apostles, the seventy disciples‚ and
others that filled up the number of the hundred and twenty,
mentioned Acts i. 15.

It is said of Mnason, that he was ἀρχαῖος μαθητὴς, cm olel
disciple, Acts xxi. [6. It may be supposed of him, that he
had been a disciple ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς, from the beyiuuin9; that is,
from the very time wherein Christ himself published his glad
tidings. Those words ἀφ’ ἡμερῶν ἀρχαίων, α 90οῶ while ayo,
Acts xv. 7, ought to be understood also in this sense.

Ver. 3 : Παρηκολουθηκότι ἄνωθεν πᾶσιν· Haviuy hadpeaffsect un-
der-standing] of all thiuys from the veryfirst] This is not indeed
ill rendered, haviuy understood these thiu'qs from the very first .-
but it may perhaps be better, having) attained to au under-
staudz'uy of these thiuys from above‚—from heaven it-self. So
ἄνωθεν, from above, signifies οὐρανόθεν, from heaven, John iii.
3, 313 xix. 11; James i. 173 iii. ¹7> &e. For,

feet understanding of these things from above, or by divine
inspiration‚ did understand themfrom the beyium'uy.

ΙΙ. Take notiee of the distinction that is in Josephus θ,
Δεῖ τὸν ἄλλοις παράδοσιν πράξεων ἀληθινῶν ὑπισχνούμενον, αὐτὸν
ἐπίστασθαι, ταύτας πρότερον ἀκριβῶς· He thal undertakes to yive
a true relation of thinys to others, ouyht himself to know them
first very accuralelffii} παρηκολουθηκότα τοῖς γεγονόσιν, ὴ παρὰ
τῶν εἰδότων πυνθανόμενον, scavino either ‘very d'il'iyeutly observed
rhem himself, or learned by iuquiry from others. We see he
opposeth τὸν παρηκολουθηκόθα to τῷ πυνθανομένῳ. Now if
St. Luke had writ his history as “ he had learned from
others'' (as they wrote whom he instances in ver. 1), then
he had been amongst the πυνθανομένους, those that haol learned
from others‚· not the παρηκολουθηκότας. Nor could he pro-
mise more than they might do, of whom he said, πολλοὶ ἐπε-
χείρησαν, &e., that many had taken iu haud, ἄπο.

Κράτιστεῖ Θεόφιλε· Most eoeoelleut Theophilus] There is one
guesses this most excellent Theophilus to have been an Anti-
ochian, another thinks he may be a Romam but it is very
uncertain either who or whence he was. There was one
