with the Babylonian Talmud, but with the Jerusalem hardly
ever, or very rarely.

The second thing observable in this man's amswer, is, that
he adds, “And thy neighbour as thyself :⁶⁶ which indeed was
not written in the schedules of their phylacteries: otherwise
I should have thought the man had understood those words
of our Saviour, πῶς ἀυαγινώσκεις, How readest thou? as if he
had said, ‘⁴ How dost thou repeat the sentences of thef phy-
lacteries?'' for he reciteth the sentence as it was in their
phylacteries, only adding this clause, “ And thy neighbour,’'
&c. Now the usual expression for the recitation of their
phylacteries was 9702* ΓἾᾪ which, word for word, is, They

every day repeat the very decalogue itself ; but they did not
repeat it, lest the heretics should say, that only those com-
mandments were given to Moses on Mount Sinai.” However,
they did repeat those passages wherein they supposed the
decalogue was sumnied up.

XVhethen therefore, this lawyer of ours understood the
words of our Saviour as having respect to that usage of re-
peating their phylacteries; or whether he of his own accord,
and according to his own opinion, would be giving the whole
sum of the decalogue, he shews himself rather a textual than a.
traditional doctor, although the word νομικὸς, lawyer, seems to
point out the latter rather.
