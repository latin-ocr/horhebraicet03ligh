Now before the feast day ofthe Passover: but by what authority
they add day it concerns them to make out. For,

Ι. In the common language of the Jews, ΠΞΞΠ ἎΠ, and
,ΠἾΒὩΠ λΠ, and mmor! 2er do never signify less than tlte
whole fistivity and time ofPassover‚ Penta-ost, and Tabernacles,
no part of that time being excepted3 nor does the word ἑορτὴ,
feast, occur anywhere throughout the whole Bible in another
signification.

II. It is something harsh to exclude the paschal supper
out of the title τῆς ἑορτῆς τοῦ πάσχα, of the feast of the Pass-
over, because the name of the whole feast takes its original
from it. This they do who imagine this supper mentioned
in this place to have been the0 paschal supper, and yet it
was πρὸ τῆς ἑορτῆς τοῦ πάσχα, before the feast of the Passover.

We have therefore shewn‚ by many arguments in our notes
upon Matt. xxvi.2‚6‚ that the supper here mentioned was the
same with that at Bethany, in the house of ‘ Simon the leper,'
two days before the Passover.

Ver. 2: Καὶ δείπνου γενομένου· And supper bein-q ended]
I acknowledge the aorist, and yet do not believe the supper
was now ended. W e have the very same word in the story of
the same supper, Matt. xxvi.6; τοῦ δὲ Ἰησοῦ γενομένου ἐν
Βηθανίᾳ, ancl Jesus being] in Bethany: which in St. Mark is
καὶ ὄντος αὐτοῦ ἐν Βηθανίᾳ, and being] in Bethany, chap. xiv. 3:
so that δείπνου γενομένου is no more than δείπνου ὄντος,
‘ beiny' supper.

Let us join the full story together. While J esus? was at
supper in the house of Simon the leper two days before the
Passover, a woman comes and pours very precious ointment
upon his head. When some murmured at the profuseness of
the expense, he defends the woman and the action by an apo-
log-y: and having finished his apology, he rises immediately
from the table, as it were, in the very midst of supper, and
