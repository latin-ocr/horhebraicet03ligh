“ Saitht Abraham to God, ‘ Didst thou not raise up seventy
nations unto Noah 3² God saith unto him, ‘ I will raise up that
nation unto thee of whom it is written, How great a nation
is it 2² '¹ [quoe qens tam magma] The Gloss is t “ That peculiar
people, rum& 'y ³737 ΠἾἾΠἾ excelliny all the secenty natans,
that holy nation‚ as the holy language excels all the seventy
languages.'''

There are numberless passages of that kind. Now when
this arrogant doctrine and vainglorying, if familiarly known
amongst the Gentiles, could not but stir up a great deal of
hatred, and consequently danger to the Jews, I should
ratheru think the interpreters might make such additions as
these, through the caution and cunning of avoiding the danger
they apprehend, than that ever they were originally in the
text of Moses. To wit, by adding another Cainan‚ and five
souls to those seventy in J acob's retinue, they took care that
the Gentiles should not, in the Greek Bibles‚ find exactly the
seventy nations in Gen. x, but seventy-two‚ (or seventy-three
if we reckon Ἐλισέι, Elisa, also 3) as also not seventy‚ but
seventy-five souls that went down into Egypt.

It was the samo kind of craft they used in that version,
Dent. xxxii. 8 3 whence that comparison between the seventy
souls and the sevcnty nations took its rise. Moses hath it
thus; ‘⁶ When the Most High divided the nations, when he
separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people
ἶῖζῇήτὶζγ Ὂξῑ Ἶξφζῑῖἳ accordiny to the number of the children of
Israel? But tl'iey' render it thus ; Ἕστησευ ὅρια {evam κατὰ
ἀριθμὸν ὀιγγέλωι1 Θεοῦ, He set the bozmds of tlte various, accord-
ing] to the number of tlze anqels of God. A sense indeed most
foreign from that of Moses, yet which sei-ved to obscure his
meaning, so far as might avoid any danger that might arise
from the knowledge of it. Making the passage itself so
unintelligible, that it needs an OEdipus to unriddle it; unless
they should allude to the J ewish tradition (which I do a little
suspect) concerning the severity angeIS, set over the seventy
nations of the world.

V. Butx now if this version be so uncertain, and differs so
much from the originalsshow comes it to pass that the evan-
