kindz of feast, οι· festival-time. As if he had said, ‘⁶ You
would have me go up to this feast, that Ι may be received by
my disciples with applause; but I do not go up to that kind
of festivity3 the time appointed for that affair is not yet
eome.”

Ver. 14: Τῆς ἑορτῆς μεσούσης· About the midst oftke feast]
“mm ‘7127 ἺὶῗἾΠΞ, On some work-(lay of tlm feast. But was he
not there on the first 01² sec-ond day of the feast, to perform
those things that ought to have been performed, making
ready the Ohagigahs‚ and appearing in the court? If he was
there the second day, he might be well enough said to be
there μεσούσης τῆς ἑορτῆς, about the midst of xlae feast, ἾῖἋΠΞ

'ry-m &1273 for that day was not a festiva13 unless perchance
at that time it might have been the sabbath: and for absence
the first day, there were certain Γῃηῖἳωῇ compensations might
be made.

ῑἾῖΠΝἾἼἈ ΓῺἾΞῒΨΠ “ The oompensations tlmt mmm be made
for thefirst dags were these: if any one was obliged to offer on
the first day, and did not do it, he coxnpensated by offering
upon any other slay.'‘'

But that which is here said, that “he went up into the
Temple and taught, ἑορτῆς μεσούσης, about tlte midst of the
fhast,'’ need not suppose he was absent from the beginning
of it: nor ought we rashly to think that he would neglect
any thing that had been prescribed and appointed in the
law. But it may be reasonably enough questioned, whether
he nicelyb observed all those rites and usages os the feast
that had been invented by the scribes. That is, whether he
had mic> a little tent or tabernac-le of his own, or made use
of some friend's, which was allowed and lawful to be donec·
Whether he made fourteen nieals in that little booth, as is
prescribedd. VVhether he carried 255³? bundles ofpalms and
willows about the altar, as also ᾸἹἾΠΝ α emon,- whether he
made his tent for all those seven days his fixed habitationi,
and his own house only occasional; and many other things,

largely and nicely prescribed in the canons and rules about
this feast.
