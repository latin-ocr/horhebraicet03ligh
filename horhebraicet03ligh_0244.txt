238 IIebrew and Talmudical [Oh. i. 1.

It is observed almost by all that have of late undertaken a
commentary upon this evangelist, that ΠἾἿἽ NWDWdee Word
of the Lord, doth very frequently occur amongst the Tar-
gumists, which may something enlighten the matter now
before us. “Andb Moses brought the people out of the

campe ''W'T ᾺἾὮἾΌ Ham-117³? to meet the lVord of tlze L0rd3’
ΗἯἾ ΝἾὩἾὩ ΞἾζΞΞἾ, “And the W‘ord of the Lord accepted the

sace of J ob (Ψ ἶἾΠῖἳ *fs-TW* '³³7 &vam And the Word of the
Lorol shall lauyk them to scorne. “ They believed ΞἹΨΞ
ΠἾἿὩἾΌ in the omme of his Wordfl’ ”57:⁸0 ῠΠῚ And my
Word Spar-ed themg. To add no more, Gen. xxvi. 3, instead of
“ I will be with thee,'’ the Targum hath it '173702 ἻἾΌἿὩ ἾΠἾἹ
And my Word shall be thina help. So Gen. xxxix. 2, ‘⁶ And the

Lord was with Josephae’ Targ. nrm-02 'ww-r mem rrum
ἣῦἿἾἾ And the Word of the Lord was Joseplz's helper. And

so, all along, that kind of phrase is most familiar amongst
thern.

Though this must be also confessed‚ that the word &57:³72
doth sometimes signify nothing else but I, Thou, He, and is
frequently applied to men too. So Job vii. 8, “ Thine eyes
are upon me ;'' Targ. *anum ³1:³2⁹. Again, Job xxvii. 3,
“ My breath is in me ;” ἾἾὩἿὮΞ 'mmm Targ. 2 Chron. xvi.
3, “ There is a league between me and thee :⁹⁵ Targ. ΝῺἯΡ
ἾἾΌἾΌ ΓΞἸ *savz ΓΞ. Chap. xxiii. 16, ‘⁶ He made a eove-
nant between him and between all the people, and between
the king ;” Targ. 3³2³ sm> ΒΓ, Γῑπ mmm ΓΞ, ωηο
&Dlvnff ΝἾὮἾῺ. Ι observe, that in Zeeh. vii. 12, the Tar-
gumist renders ἾΠἾἾΞ by lais Spir'z‘t, ΠἾἾῺἺΞΞ, by lais W0rd3
if at least that may in strietness be so rendered3 for by what
bath been just alleged it seemsh that ΠἾἾὩἿῺΞ, ’Ἣ may be

translated, Tlce Lord by himself, or lee Lord himself. Ι ob-
serve further, that the Greek interpreters, having mistaken

the vowels of the word ἾΞἾ in Habak. iii. 5, have rendered
it πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ πορεοσεται λόγος, before his face shall 90

‘ α word ς’ [ἾΪΞἾ] when it should have been, πρὸ προσώπου αὐ-
