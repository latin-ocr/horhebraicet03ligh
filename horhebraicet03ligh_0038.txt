we reckon it? I would lay it in his one-and-thirtieth, the very
year wherein our Saviour was born. Of this year Dion Gas-
sius, lib. lv, speaks thus:

Πληρωθείσης δὲ οἱ καὶ τῆς τρίτης δεκαετίας, τὴν ἡγεμονίαν τὸ
τέταρτον, ἐκβιασθεὶς δήθευ, ὑπεδέξατο· “ T lm third decennium
[or term of ten years] having] now mm out, and α fourth beyin-

that a monarchical government, in opposition to the tri-
umvimte, which at that battle breathed its last. But that,
certainly, was the pure and absolute monarchy‚ which the
senate and the commonwealth did agree and consent together
to set up.

been done before; whose words, since they concern so great
and noble a monument of antiquity, may not prove tedious to
the reader to be transcribed in this place:
