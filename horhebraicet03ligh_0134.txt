128 Hebrew aad Tahmidioal [Oh. xi. 51.

certain the Jews own no other Zacharias slain in the Temple
but himself: and what they say of his slaughter, I have
already taken notice upon that place in St. Matthew out of
both the Talmudsb. We meet with the same things in Midras
thahc, and Midras cohelethd: out os which last give me
leave briefly to transcribe these passages:

“ The blood of Zachary boiled up two hundred and fifty-
two years, from the days of J oash to the days of Zedekiah.
What did they do? They swept into it all the dust [of the
court] and made a heap; yet it eeased not, but still boiled and
bubbled up. The Holy Blessed God said to the blood, ΝΠ
ἿἻἿἻ ᾫἾἾἾἾἻ *ERN-J &35:37 Belaeolcl the tim-e is come that thou
emeret tlcys διαθήκη, [that wass, Let the Lord behold, and require
it at your hands] When Nebuzar-adan came and inquired,
what this matter was3 they answered, That it was the
blood of heifers, and rams, and lambs, which they had sacri-
ficed. Aftemvard, when he came to understand what the
matter was, he slew eighty thousand priests, and yet the
blood would not stanch‚ but broke out and flowed as far as
the tomb of Zachary. He brought together, therefore, the
Sanhedrim, both the Great and Less‚ and slew them over that
blood, and yet it did not eease,'' &c.

I hardly indeed think that those that relate this matter did
really believe it to have been actually so ; but only would by
such flowers of rhetoric ancl strained hyperboleS, paint out the
horrible guilt of the murder of Zacha1·ias; which by how much
the more horrible it was, by so much the more did it agree
with the guilt of the murder of our blessed Lord.

And however a great part of it in these relations of theirs
may be mere flourish‚ yet by the whole framing of the thing,
it must needs be observed, that the slaughter of this Zacha-
rias was so famous and rooted in the minds of that people
generally, that when our Saviour speaks of one Zacharias,
slain between the Temple and the altar, it cannot be ima-
gined that they could understand him pointing at any other
than this very man. As for his father being here called
Barachias, and not J ehoiada‚ we have spoken to that matter
elsewhere e.
