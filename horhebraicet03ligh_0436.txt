VEB. 2 : Πλέξαντες στέφανον ἐξ ἀκανθῶν, &c. Platted a eroum
of thorus, ‹Ssso.] A most unquestionable token this, that
Christ's kingdom was not of this world, when he was crowned
only with thomas and briars, which were the curse of this earth,
Gen.²iii.18. Herod had put upon him a purple robe, Luke
xxiii. 113 and the soldiers added this erown. It is likewise

Ver. ῐ 3: Εἰς τόπον λεγόμενον Λιθόστρωτον· In a place that
