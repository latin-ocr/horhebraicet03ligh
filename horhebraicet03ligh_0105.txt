the ten sorts, whereof if none should happen to be in a city,
it was not fit for any disciple of the wise to abide in itb.

II. That the fathers of the Sanhedrim were more emphati-
cally called the scribes is so well known that it needs no con-
firmation. That passage in the evangeliste sufficiently shews
it; “ The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:'' that
is, on the legislative bench, or in the Sanhedrim: where also
the Sadducees that were of that council are called scribes.-
and the scribes are distinguished there from the lerisees, not
that they were not scribes, but because all the scribes there
were not Pharisees.

HI. There was a certain degree of doctors or 861ἰόεὸ that
were in the Sanhedrim, but were not membels of it: these
are commonly called mmm-1 *32¹7 ΒἾἼΠ those who qaae
judyment in the presence of the mise men, ΠᾶἾἾΠῖὩ lii-¹²⁹7 fit
for the office of Zeyzslators, but not yet admitted. Such were
Simeon Ben Azzai, and Simeon Ben Zumahd. Such also was
Simeon the Temanite, of whom we have made mention else-
where, (out of Sanlaedrm fol. 17. 2 ,) ΏΡἾΡΞ ΞΠἮΞΒῙἼ
He yadyed in the presence of the S‘awlceclrim, szttinq upon ibe
yrouml. He did not sit on the bench with the fathers, as not
being one of their number, but on the seats below, nearer the
ground: him the fathers consulted in difficult matters. A
shadow of which we have in England of the judges, men learned
in the laws, who have their seats in our house of lords.

Whether he that was particularly called the mr! the wisa
man was of the number of the fathers, or only of this kind of
judges, Ι shall not at present dispute, but leave the reader to
judge from this story: “Rabbane Simeon Ben Gamaliel was
the &⁸³:33 the president of the Sanhediim: R. Meir was ΟΞΠ
chacam, or the wasa mam and R. Nathan, '¹112 ΠΝ tlte vece—
,ᾳουθνηονκἩ Now when Rabban Simeon had decreed something
that disparaged R. Meir and R. Nathan, ‘⁶ Saith R.. Meir to
R. Nathan, :237 ’ΞΝ Ι am tlte choream [or the wisa man],
and thou art the vice-president. Let us remove Rabban
Simeon from the presidency, then thou wilt be the president,
and Ι the vice-president.''

There is nothing more common, and yet nothing more dif-
