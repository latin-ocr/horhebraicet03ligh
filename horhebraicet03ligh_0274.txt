268 Hebrew 0ηοῖ Talmuclioal [Ch. iii. 17.

Ι. &anag nm 1171511 rimi-no 5115171) 11713 apum The
whole world kathjbrsaken the Mimas, and followed the Gomara.
Where something may be noted in the story as well as in the
grammar of it.

So John xii. 19; Ἴδε, ὁ κόσμος ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ ἀπῆλθεν· ΒθῘιοῖά
the world is 9072& after kim. In Jerusalem language, *3352 ΝΠ

ΠἾἾΠἎ 373& Νῃίᾋγ. We very often meet with &2³39 *³7³2

ἿἾἹΌ All the world coozfessetk, διο. and ἾλἾῖῖΞ &³3 &723737 *³752
The whole world dom not dissent, &c. By which kind of phrase,
both amongst them and all other languages, is meant a very
great number or multitude.

II. When they distinguish‚ as frequently they do, betwixt

ἾἿῺΠ ww& ”337 the poor of their own city, and '05in ”237

the poor of the world ,· it is easy to discern, that by the poor

of the world are meant those poor that come from any other
rts.

paIII. “ R.Ullah requires not only that every great man

should be worthy of belief, ⁸72] &Libyn wir& ibin& &³724
ῙΌὛΠῺ but that tlte maoz of the world should be so too.'' It is

easy to conceive, that by the man of the world is meant any
person, of any kind or degree.
IV. But it is principally worthy our obser vation, that they

distinguish the whole wmld into ³¹)an Israel, and ΠἹὩἹΝ
0³7³er the natz'ons of the ηοω ld the Isiaelites and the Gen-
tiles. This distinction, by which they call the Gentiles the
nations of the world, occurs almost 1n every leaf, so that I need
not bring instances of this nature. Compare Luke xii. 30 with
Matt. vi. 323 and that may suffice.

V. They further teach us, that- the natione· of the world are
not only not to be redeemed‚ but to be wasted, destroyed, and
trodden underfoot. “ This seems to me to be the sensei:
The rod of the exactor shall not depart from J udah, until his
Son shall come to whom belongsk the subduing and breaking
of the people3 for he shall vanquish them all with the edge

of his swor(l.'' So saith Rambam upon that passage in
Gen. xlix.
