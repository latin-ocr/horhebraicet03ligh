Ver. 30: Τὰ ἔθνη τοῦ κόσμου, 820. The nations of tlte world,
&ej Οἴτην rrum& is a very common form of speeeh amongst
the Jews, by which they express tlte Gentiles, or all other
nations beside themselves. Κόσμος and αἰὼν have a peculiar
propriety in sacred writ, whieh they have not in profane
authors : so that αἰὼν hath relation only to the J ewish agee,
ancl κόσμος to the nations that are not Jewish. Hence συν-
τέλεια mi· αἰῶνος, Matt. xxiv. 3, is meant tlte end of the ιῙειοιζςίι
aye, or world. And πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων, Tit. i. 2, is before tlte
Jewz‘slt world heyam. And hence it is that the world very often
in the New Testament is to be understood only of tlte Gerttile
worlcl.

Ver. 37¹³: Παρελθὼν διακονήσει· He will come forth cmd serve
them] ΓΞΨἾἿΟ ’(ΠἻ ἺΚἹἿΠ ΨὮΨ He that serves at tlte table ⁴qoes
about while tlte μηθείς sit. Παρελθὼν seems to denote the same
thing here; unless it may refer to some such thing as this,
viz. that the master will pass by his dignity, and conclescemt to
minister to his own servants

Ve1·.38: Ἐν τῇ δευτέρᾳ φυλακῇ, καὶ ἐν τῇ τρίτῃ· In tlte second
walch, ancl in tlte third] ln the very dead watches of all, at least,
if there be not a soleoism in speech. [In vstyttiis scilicet (absit
soloecismus) somrtolentt'ssimisa] At the first watclc they went
to bed3 and at the fourth match, the time of getting up again
came on : so that the second and the third watclt was the very
dead time of sleep.

Ver. 47 : Δαρήσεται πολλάς· ›Sltall be beaten with many
stripes] There was a stated number of stripes‚ and that was
fort-y, beyond which no malefactor, condemned by the judges
to that punishment, ought to receive. Whence that passaged
seems a little strange: “ He that kills a heifer, and after-
ward two of that heifer’s calves, ΞὋἸῸΚΖ] λῦἸῠ, let ltz‘m be
beaten with fourscore strt'pesss' How so? som-seore, when they
ought not to exeeed above forty⁶3 They might not exeeed
that number for one single crime : but if the crime was
doubled, they might double the punishment. And it may be
a question, whether they did not double their accusatione
