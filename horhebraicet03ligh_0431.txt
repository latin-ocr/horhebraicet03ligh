Ch. xviii. 31.] Exercitations upon St. John. 425

Let us now, in order, put the whole matter together:

Ι. The Sanhedrim were most stupidly and unreasonably
remiss in their punishment of capital offenders, going upon
this reason especially, that they accounted it so horrible a
thing to sentence an Israelite to death. Forsooth‚ he is of
the seed of Abraham, of the blood and stock of Israe13 and
you must have a care how you touch such a one l

“ R. Eliezerf Bar R. Simeon had laid hold on some thieves.
R. Joshua Bar Korchah sent to him, saying, 1³* 32 ΫὮΠ
‘ Ο thou 272‘neyar, the son of ¹qood wine’ '² [i. e. O thou wicked son
of a good father], ‘⁶ ‘ how long wilt thou deliver the people of
God to the slaughterZ' He answered and said, [3³pr Πιὶῧῖο
ΒἾΞΠ ἶῖ) ‘I root the thorus out of the vineyarcl? To whom
the other, ‘ Let the Lord of the vineyard come and root them
out himself.'” lt is worth noting that the very thieves of
Israel are the people of God: and O! they must not be
touched by any means, but referred to the judgment of God
himself.

“ Wheng R. Ismael Bar R. J ose was constituted a magis-
trate by the king, there happened some such thing to him ;
for Elias himself rebuked him, saying, ‘ How long wilt thou
deliver over the people of Grod to slaughter 2’ ” Hence thath
which we alleged elsewhere: “ The Sanhedrim that happens
to sentence any one to death within the space of seven years
is called ‘ a destroyen’ R. Eleazar Ben Azariah saith, ‘ It is
so, if they should but condemn one within seventy years? ”

ΙΙ. It is obvious to any one, how this foolish remissness
and letting loose the reins of judgment would soon increase
the number of robbers, murder-ers, and all kind of wickedness:
and, indeed, they did so abundantly multiply, that the San-
hedrim neither could nor durst, as it ought, call the criminals
to account. The laws slept while wickedness was in the height
of its revels3 and punitive justice was so out of countenance,
that, as to uncertain murders, they made no search3 and
certain ones they framed no judgment against.

“ Sincei the time that homicides multiplied‚ the beheading
the licifer ceased.” And in the place before quoted in Avodahk ;
