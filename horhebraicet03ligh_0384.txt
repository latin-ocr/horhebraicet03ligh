served some of this ointment sor this use: which Ι have had
occasion to mention elsewhere. If this exposition do not
take‚ then add this clause, “ Let her alone :'' for this may
be an argument and sign that she hath not done this vainly,
luxuriously, or spent so costly an ointment upon me upon any
delicacy; because she hath reserved it for thisg time, wherein
I am so near my grave and funeral, and poured it not on me
before.

Ver. 12: ’Όχλος πολὺς ὁ ἐλθὼν εἷς τὴν ἑορτήν· Muok people
that were come to the feast] It is not greatly to our present
purpose to enlarge in counting the multitude that flocked to
the Passover. However‚ let the reader take this story in his

hardly ever seen such a confiux of people as was at this very
feast which we are now upon, they being gathered thither from
all nations of the world, Acts ii: for that they were at the
Passover as well as at pentecost, there are hardly any, Ι be-
lieve, but will suppose.
