stitutions of those sects, that, as to what related to the doc-
trine of Christ, there was nothing wanting to have cut off
those heresies and vanities.

III. This great Shepherd broke that covenant that had
been made and confirmed with that people‚ ver. 10: “I took
my staff, even Beauty‚ and cut it asunder, that I might break
my covenant which I had made with all the people.'' With
all the people; i. e. with all Israel, the ten and the two tribes
too. And in ver. 14, the affinity and kin which was betwixt
J udah and Israel is dissolved; which it would not be amiss
for those to take serious notice of, who as yet expect a uni-
versal conversion of the whole nation of the Jews. Let them
say by virtue of what eovenant; if the eovenant of grace, that
makes no difference betwixt the J ew and the Greek, nor knows
any one after the flesh. If by virtue of the covenant pecu-
liarly made with that people, that was broken and dissolved,
when God had gathered his flock out of that people. For,

IV. Thei great Shepherd, when he came, found that there
must be a flock gathered in that nation, Λεῖμμα κατ’ ἐκλογὴν

yracoe and these he took care to call and gather before
Jerusalem should be destroyed. Zechariah himself calls it

poor os theflock, ver. 7. WVhere, by the way, whoever com-
pares the Greek version in this place must needs observe, that

³⁵2? ἶ) so the poor is, by those interpretem, jumbled and con-
founded into one word. For, instead of {tiz-Er] ³122 l: ³972]
[v. ι 1.] omd so the poor of thestock knew, they read it, ’γυώσονῖται
οῖ Χαναναῖοι τὰ πρόβατα, 850. tlte Oanaoenites shall know the
sheep, &c. So instead of ἶζήζκζζγ ὴᾎὲξ μὶ) for this, or χόν you,
O poor of mestoc& ver. 7, they read, εἰς τὴν Χανααυίτιν, emto
elza land of canaan. Whence, after that we have taken notice
that they read Nun final in 1: as not final, Ι have some sus-
picion that these interpreters might have had an eye upon

the reduction of the dispersed captivity into the land of Ca-

naan, according to the common expectation of that nation.
But this only by the by.
That of the apostle ought to be strictly heeded ; Οὕτως οῧυ καὶ
