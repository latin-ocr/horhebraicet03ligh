place alleged, it is under the controversy, whether it signify
cockcrowiny, or the proclamation of the sayan, οι· ruler of the
Temple; viz, that proclamation mentioned a, “The sayan
saith unto them, ‘Go and see whether the time for slaying
the sacrifices be at hand) If it were time, then he that was
sent out to see returned with this answer, ‘ The day begins to
break,' '' 820.

If the phrase *³32 nwap be to be taken in this sense, then
however we see that the people were assembled together be-
fore morning light: and yet I do not doubt but it ought to
be rendered the cockcrowinffi which might be made clear by
many good proofs, is there were place or leisure for it. Now
the people’s assembling in the court thus soon in the morning
on these feast days was upon this account3 because on the
first day of the feast, innumerable peace ‹ffirinys [D'levw]
were to be made, which were the Olzagyiyah, ‚· and on the second
day, as many burnt offerings for the appearance of the people
before the Lord [comparitione]

It is true indeed the victims were not slain before the
morning light; but we may very well suppose that before
they could be slain they must be searched and examined by
the Municheh, or any that were deputed to that office, to see
whether the beasts allotted for sacrifice were without ble-
mish, and fit for the altar, yea or no. And upon this account
they assembled, and the sacrifices were brought into the court
so early in the morning. And now let us call a little to mind
Annas the sayan, or ruler of the Temple. Might not he also
be in the Temple very early in the morning? Did not his
charge require it, to see that all things might be provided
and put into a readiness for the service of that day? Let us
consider what hath been newly quoted ; “ The sayan or ruler
saith, ‘Go and see if the time for killing the sacrifice be
come ;' '' i. e. whether daylight appear or ne. And from
hence, it may be, we may gather the reason why Annas was
not amongst the rest in Caiaphas's palace; and why they
brought our Saviour before him first3 viz. because his
affairs in the Temple would not permit him to sit at that
time with the Sanhedrim; and yet they had a mind Christ
should be carried before him, before hc himself should³ be
