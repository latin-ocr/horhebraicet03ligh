424 Hebrew (mol⁴ Talmudioal [Ch. xviii. 31.

judge r'l'lvlp ὊἿἺ judyments quulcts? '⁹ The Gloss is: “ Those
are the judgments about finding any that offered violence,
that eutice a maid, and the price of a servant. When, there-
fore, they did not sit in the room Gazitk, they did not judge
about these thingsg and so those judgments about mulcts or
fines ceased.”

Here we have one part of their judiciary power lost, not
taken away from them by the Romans, but falling of itselfi as
it were, out of the hands of the Sanhedrim. Nor did the
Romans indeed take away their power of judging in capital·
matters, but they, by their own oscstancy, supine and un-
reasonable lenity, lost it themselves For so the Gemara
goos on ε

“ Rabh Nachman Bar Isaac saith, ‘ Let him not say that
they did not judge judgments of mulcts, but that they did
not judge capital judgments. And whence comes this?
rumh ’ἓν &³³2³ prum πτῑ) ψει-τ ww ιν), When
they] saw that so many mufrderers multiplied upon them, that
they could not well judffe and call them to account, they said,
It is better for us that we remove from place to place,
ΞἾἾΠίἸ ΝἰῖἾ ὉἾΠ Ὁ for how can we otkemvise⁹³ [sitting
horo and not punishing them] “not contremet a quilt upon
ourselves ,θ’ '’

They thought themselves obliged to punish murderors
while they sat in the room Gazz'tlb : ΕἾἾᾺ ΒἾΡῺΓΉΠ, for the
place itself enyayecl them to it. They are the words of the
Gomarists. Upon which the Gloss: “The room Gazitlc was
half of it within and half of' it without the Holy Place. The
reason of which was, that it was requisite that the council
should sit near the Divine Majesty, Hence it is that they
say, ‘ Whoever constitutos an unfit judge, is as if he planted
a grove by the altar of the Lord: as it is written, J udges and
officers shalt thou make thee :’ and it follows presently after,
‘ Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the
altar of the Lord thy God,’ Deut. xvi. 18, 21. They removed
therefore from Gazitlc, and sat in the Tabernoe. Now though
tho Tabernoe were upon the Mountain of the Temple, yet they
did not sit so near the Divine Majesty there as they did when
they sat in the room Gazitlc.'' ⁵
