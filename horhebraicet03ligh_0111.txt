1. Take such a Gloss as is frequently in use amongst the
allegorizing doctorsc: &ww ΠἻῚΞἾ :mn ¹7:12 *UND ¹7:22

'‘TND 'JND '5³7 ΠἾἾΌ ἾἹΓἹ 7³²) ἻἺἿὉ With what measure lm
shall mete to thee, do thou precise him exceedingyly. W here we

see they play with the sound of words, nm: and ΠἾὮ and
ΠἾἹῚΞ, which is a very common thing with them to do. Aben
Ezra : “ ἾἺΝῺ is of the same sense with 'TND *VNKQ exmed-
iozyly, eaeceeclinyly; and intends thus much: Love him ex-
ceedingly, as much as ever thou art able, and let thy love be
perfect in thine heart.

2. To this we may add, if we think fit, what they com-
monly require in all religious services; viZ. 2³7 mn: the pre-
paration and the intention of the mind. From all which we
may conceive that this was the common interpretation of that
clause sslffhkm·3722?!; and that ἐξ ὅλης τῆς διανοίας, with my
whole mind, was not added without just cause, but upon some
necessity, there being something of obscurity in the word
3⁸1⁶N793 and so we might be apt to apply it only to our

bodily 01· outward strength and might. Moses's words,
therefore, are rendered by the evangelists not strictly and
according to the letter, as they are in him, or were in the
parchments in the phylacteries ; but both according to their
full sense and tenour‚ as also according to the common and
received interpretation of that nation.

“ R.Levid Bar Chajothah went to Caesarea, and heard them

pnouwlvbz 35sz 3³³³? recitiny their ⁶ Skemaa' [ore their phys-
Zactem'es] Helleozistioally [i. e. in Greek} &a Now, whether the
clause we are now handling was inserted there, it would be in
vain to inquire, because not possible to find: but if the Jews
thought it included in the word ζῐἻζΝξζ), which is not unlikely,
then is it probable that the Helleriists used it expressly in the

Greek tongue.
Ι cannot but take notice of the words of the Jerusalem

Targumist just now alleged; 27sz ΓἿἾῘ) 35³7? ynw: what
should that word 37³3? mean? Aruclz, quoting this passage,
hath it thus, amm Ἤρ ἾἾΠἻ DL) mmm so that 35³7? seems to

be the same with 37¹7, and p is redundant3 which is not unusual
