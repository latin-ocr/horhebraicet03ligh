122 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xi. 4¹·

to this purpose, ‘ Give but alms, and all things are clean unto
you.⁷” When I observe alnongst the Talmudists, how the
word ΓῬΝ and ΝΓὌΝ is used, when any thing is put or
determined, (especially when ἾῺΠ &rme occurs, I question
whether it be the same with 'DN &HN come, see,· or it is so,
sea) Ι cannot but persuade myself that the ἐνόντα in this
place looks something that way ε ‘ Your inward part is full of
ravening3 but the positions and tenets that obtain amongst
you are, θέτε alms,' &a

ΙΙ. However, grant that τὰ ἐνόντα denotes that which is
over aad above, or that which glou leave, (for I will not be very
tenacious in this 3) yet it is hardly probable that our Saviour
utters this as his own, but rather as the words and opinion of
the Pharisees. Nor do Ι think that he· speaks these things
directly‚ or by way of direction to tlzem, but that he cites their
tenets in inere scoff and displeasure. For indeed, this prin-
ciple was the spawn of their own schools, that giving of alnis
had a value in it that served for atonenoent, justification‚ sal-
vation, every thing. Hence that common term that reached
so comprehensively, ΠῙΞἺΒ, riylcteousness. And hence is it
that, in those numberless places in the Holy Scriptures‚
where the praises of justice and riylzteoasozess are celebrated,
and all the blessings of it pronounc'ed, they apply it all to the
qivifnq of alms. Take one instance for all: “Rabhk Asai
saith, ΓΠἾΕΌΠ ³7: *5:132 rip-mn Πῖἳψῐζ] Alms is eqwivalent to
all the other eomma7zdments.” “ R. Judah saith ¹, Griving of
alms is a great thing; for it hastens our redemption. It is
written, [Prov. x. 4,] npgm ‘7³35 ’ΠΕ-ΞΕ. riylzteousness, [i. e.
giving] of alms,] delivers from death. Alnisgiving delivereth
from sudden death, and from the judgment of hell. R. Meir
saith, If any wicked man should make this objection, that if
your God love the poor, why doth he not seed them? do thou
make this answer; it is, that we by them might be delivered
from the judgment of hell?

Im fear, indeed, that the Greek interpreters have a touch
of this [micam aliquam ejusdem salis sapiant} when they so
oftentimes render rip-13 justice by ἐλεημοσύνην, 01· yiviny
of alms. So that the reader may judge whether our Sa-
