containing three logs out of Siloam. W hen they came to the
water gate” [a gate of the Temple so called, as some would
have it, because that water which was fetched from Siloam
was brought through it], “they sounded their trumpets and
sang. Then a priest goes up by the ascent of the altar, and
turns to the left. There were two silver vessels, one with
water, the other with wine: he pours some of the water into

the wine, and some of the wine into the water, and so per-
forms the service.''

‘⁶ R. Judah saith, They offer one log every of those eight
days: and they say to him that offered it„ ‘Lift up thy
hand ε’ for upon a certain time there was one that offered it
upon [super] his feet’'[Ge1nar. He was a Sadducee. Gloss:
The Sadducees do not approve the offering of water]‚ “and
the whole congregation pelted him with their citrons. That
day a horn of the altar was broke.''

‘⁶ Whoeverf hath not seen the rejoicing that was upon the
drawing of this water, hath never seen any rejoieing at all.”

This offering of water, they say, was a tradition given at
mount Sinaig: and that the prophet J onah was inspired by
the Holy Ghost upon this offering of waterh.

If you ask what foundation this usage hath, Rambam will
tell us, ΠἿἾΠΞ trane: &mn ³³3 VJ* “ There are some kind
qf remote hints of it in tlze law. However those that will not
believe the traditional law, will not believe this article about
the sacrifice of water.”

ΠΞΝἹΚΠΠ ΠἚ, tlw house Qfdrdwiozy ,· for it is written, “ With
joy shall ye draxv water,'' διο. Isa. xii. 3³.

L This rejoicing (which we have described before) they called

¹, ΠἾἸΠ Til-mm the rqjoz‘cinq of the law, or for the law: for by

l waters they often understand the law, Isa. lv. Ι, and se-
veral other places; and from thence the rejoicing for these
waters. ,

ΙΙ. But they add moreover, that this drawing and offering
of water signifies the pouring out of the Holy Spirit.
