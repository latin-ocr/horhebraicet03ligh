“ It‘ is a tradition of the Rabbins. If one, in walking near
any city, see lights in it, if the greatest number in that city
be Cuthites, let him not bless them 3 if they be most Israelites,
let him bless it. nrm: :m &ww ῙΞΠ They teacla ⁴ the begin-
πέψω) when they say, Illost Outkites: ‘mauu ΞἾἾ {st-:³0 &m
They teaclb ‘ the em& when they say, Most Israelitesss’ For the
chief and principal scruple was, whether they should pronounce
a blessing upon those lights when there might be most Outhites
in the city that lighted them up: the lesser scruple waS,
whether he should bless them if there were most Israelites in
that city.

“Thereu is a dispute upon that precept, Levit. xvii. 13, If
any one kill a beast or bird upon a holy day, the Shammean
school saith, Let him dig with an instrument and cover the
blood x, The school of Hillel saith, Let him not kill at all, if
he have not dust ready by him to cover the blood.”

&²:³³0 The end, or the secondary question, is about covering
the blood if a beast should be killed. ΝΨἿἾ Tlce baymam-9,
or the principal question, is about killing a beast or a fowl at
all upon a holy day, merely for the labour of scraping up
dust, if there be none at hand.

There are numberless instances of this kind: and if our
Saviour ha'd any respect to this form οι· mode of speaking,
we may suppose what he said was to this purpose: “ You
ask who I am? &ww The beyimzinq. That is the chief thing
to be inquired into, which I now say, viz. That I am the
light of the world, the Messiah, the Son of God, &c. But
what works I do, what doctrines 1 teach, and by what au-
thority, &0³D, this is an inquiry of the second place, in com-
parison to that first and chief question, who I am.

Ver. 26: Ἀλλ’ ὁ πέμψας με ἀληθής ἐστι· But ke that sent me
is treta] ‘⁴ I have many things to say and judge of you; but
ke that sent me hath of old said and judged of you; ‘and
he is true? and they are true things which he hath said of
you.” Of this kind are those passages, Isaiah xi. 10, “ Make
the heart of this people fat‚'' &c.; and xxix. 10, ‘⁶ The Lord
hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep,'' διο. : and
from such kind of predictions it is, that Christ concludes this
concerning them, ver. 21, “ Ye shall die in your sins.’'
