&anns 5¹7 ΓΝΨ ῘΞῘὫ In a white vestanam, wlaerein there was no
seam.'' The Gloss is, “ The whole garment was made of one
thread, and not as our clothes are, which have their sleeves
sewedb to the body with a seam.’' But he gives a very
senseless reason why his coat was without a seam3 viz„ to
avoid the suspicion lest Moses should at any time hide any
consecrated money within the seams of his coat.

Ver. 36 : Ὄξος προσέφερον αὐτῷ· They brouykt lzim vineymz]
Vina-(yar was the common drink of the Roman soldiers 3 and
hence those to whom the custody of crucified persons was
committed had it always ready by them. “ He commanded
that no soldier should drink wine in their expedition, but that
every one should content himself with vineqarw

“ The provision this man (viz.‚ Misitlms) made in the com-
monwealth was such, that there never was any great frontier-
city which had not vivzeyar, bread-corn‚ and bacon, and barley,
and chaff, laid up for a whole yeard‚'' &a “ Thoue shalt give
us as much hay, chaff, vinayar, herbs, and grase, as may
suffice us.”

with myrrh, and of vineyar too3 viZ.‚ a twofold cup: one,
before he was nailed to the cross, i. e. of wine mingled with
inm-rh,- the other, of υἰηθραν, while he hung there: the first,
given by the Jews according to their custon1; the second, by
the soldiers‚ in abuse and mockery. But if you will grant a
third cup, then all difficulty vanisheth indeed. Let the first
be wine minyled with myrrlz ‚· the second, vineqar minyled with
yall ; the third, mere vineyczr .· which the soldiers gave to
malefactore if they had desired drink, being that which they
drank themselves, Hence the σκεῦος ὄξους μεστὸν, the vessel
filled with vineyar, was always in readiness, that the soldiers
might drink when they had a mind, and persons also upon
the cross, if they stood in need of it.

Ver. 42: Μνήσθητί μου, Κύριε· Lord, remember ma] Christ
is now upon the cross‚ as of old J oseph was in the prison, be-
tween two malefactore. There one of them was delivered,
