tained by money [there are also that say how they murdcred
one another by chamus and witchcrafts]‚ there were fourscorc
high priests served in that time: fourscore and one, say some;
fourscore and two, say others3 and there are thatsay four-
score and four. Amongst these, Simeon the Just sat forty
” years: but when the placo was bought and sold, the years of
enjoying it were cut short. The story goes of one that sent
his son with two bushels of silver [to purchase the high
priest’s office]‚ and the bushels themselves were silver.
Another sent his son with two bushels of gold, and the
bushels themselves were of gold too.''

Asi to this difference of numbers, we will not much trouble
our heads about it : perhaps the Gemarists might reckon the
sagans together with the high priests, for they were indeed
deputed to minister in their stead‚ if any uncleanness had
happened to them. Let there be fourscore high priests, or
thereabouts, it is certain that so frequent were the changes
and successions amongst them, that the high priest of this
year was hardly so the year that went before or that followed
after. Although indeed in this Caiaphas it was something·
otherwise, yet did the evangelist justly and properly enough
add this clause, that ke was tlze myli priest tleat same year,-
tacitly noting the common state of affairs as to the office of
high priest at that time,

story: they would therefore have the twenty-fourth verse
weaved in here, “Annas sent J esus bound to Caiaphas:” be-
cause what is hore related and so on seems all to have been
done in Oaiaphas's hall, and not in Annas's.

This order the Syr.² Arab., V ulg. interpretem, and others do
still observe: Nonnus, [Dionysius] Oarthusianusk, Beza, and,
as he quotes him, St. cyril, invert it. lt is true there is here
a tacit transition, and a trajection of thel words in verse 24,
which is not very usual3 but neither the one nor the other
seems to be without some reason for it.
