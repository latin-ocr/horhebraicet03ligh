ward from the beginning of the barley-harvest, or the middle
of the month Nisan, and we shall go back to the middle of
the month Chisleu3 which will fall in with the beginning
of our December, or thereabout: whence it will be easy to
conjecture what feast that was of which mention is made,
chap. v. 1.

Ver. 46: Βασιλικός· Α ηοόίωηαη.] Thi's noblemom, probably,
might be some Herodian, such as we find mentioned, Matt.
xxii. 163 not merely a servant or attendant upon Herod the
tetrarch, who reigned at this time, but one devoted to
Herod's family, out of principles of conscience and submis-
sion. For we have elsewhere shewn the controversy in
that nation about the introducing of Herod the Great into
the government‚ and whether there was not a spice of that
quarrel in the differences of the Shammeans and the Hillelites,
might be a matter worth our inquiry‚ but not in this place.
But suppose this nobleman at present to have been an at-
tendant upon Herod the tetrarch (Setting aside that contro-

‘⁶ Except ye see signs and wonders‚ ye will not believe,'' may
have this tendency and design in them: The Jews they re-
quired signs, 1 Cor. i. 22 3 but Herod's court was especially
to be charged with this curiosity, because they had heard
John the Baptist, yea, even the tetrarch himself, with some
kind of observance and veneration3 and yet because John
shewed no sign, ‘⁴ did no miracle‚'' John x, 41, he was the
easilier thrown into prison and not believed: for the story of

his imprisonment immediately follows. Compare that passage
with Luke xxiii. 8.

VER. Ι : Μετὰ ταῦτα ἢν ἑορτὴ τῶν Ἰουδαίων· A fter this there
was a feast of the Jews] The other evangelist-s speak but
sparingly of Ghrist's acts in Judea; this of ours something
more copiously. They mention nothing of the Passovers from
his baptism to his death, excepting the very last3 but St. John
points at them all. The first he speaks of chap. ii. 13; the
third, chap. vi. 43 the fourth, chap. xiii. 1 3 and the second, in
this place. It is true he does not call it by the name of the

Passover here, but only a feast in general. However, the
