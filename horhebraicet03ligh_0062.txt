inq of Bahal ; so that he was there more generally called
Sheshbazzar. But he might securely resume the name in
Judea, when Cyrus and Darius had now fanned and sifted
Babylon. So his two sons, Meshullam and Hananiah‚ could
not properly be called, one of them Abduci, the ylorgs of
mg! father, and the other Rhesa, a prinae, while they were in
Babylon; but in Judea they were names fit and suitable-
enough.

III. Of the variation of names here, and in Matt. i., l have
already spoken in that place: to wit, that Neri was indeed
the father of Salathiel3 though St. Matthew saith J echoniah
(who died ehildless, J er. xxii. 30) begat him : not that· he was
his son by nature, but was his heir in succession.

Ver. 36 i: Τοῦ Καϊνάν· The son of Catinam] I will not launoh
widely out into a controversy ‘that hat-h been sufficient-ly ban-
died already. I shall despatch, as briefly as I may, what may
seem most satisfactory in this matter :

Ῑ. There is no doubt, and indeed there are none but will
grant that St. Luke hath herein followed the Greek version.
This, in Gon. xi. 12, 13, relates it in this manner: Καὶ ἔζησεν
Ἀρφαξὰδ ἕκατον τριακονταπέντε ἔτη, καὶ ἐγέννησε τὸν Καῐνάν, &c.
“Arphaoead lived α hundred ancl fiee and thirty years, asad
haqat Oainan‚· and Cainan lived a hundred and thirty years,
and begat Salah: and Cainan lived after he had begot Salah
three hundred and thirty years.''

Consulting Theophilusj about this matter, l eannot bnt
observe of this author, that he partly follows the Greek ver-
sion, in adding to Arphaxad a hundred years, and partly not,
when he omits Cainan: for so he3 Ἀρφαξὰὸ δ’ ἐτέκνωσε Σαλᾶ,
ὢν ἐτῶν ρλε’. ΑνρῘια.τα(ί, wlcan ke was a hundred ancl thirty-
five years of agre, beqat salah. Nor can l but wonder at him
that translates him, that he should of his own head insert k,
‘⁶ Arphaxad was a hundred and thirty-five years old, and
begat a son named Oainan. Cainan was a hundred and
thirty years old, and begat Salah :'' when there is not one
syllable of Cainan in Theophilus. A very faithful interpreter
