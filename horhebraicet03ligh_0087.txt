Let us take an instance of this in the last >Passover om·
Saviour kept.

The paschal lamb was eaten on the fifth day of the week,
our Thursday ς the first day of the feast was the sixth day of
the week‚ our F riday, the day on which our Lord was erueified.
The day declining towards night (about the time that our
Lord was buried), they went out that were deputed by the
Sanhedrim to reap the sheaf : and on the morrow, that was
their sabbath, whiles our Saviour slept in the grave, they
offered that sheaf. That day therefore was the δευτέρα or
the second day, and from thence they counted the weeks to
Pentecost. And the sabbaths that came between took their
name from that δευτέρα, that second day. The first sabbath
after that was δευτεροπρῶτον, the first sabbath after the second
day‚· and the next sabbath after that was ὃευτεροὸεύτεροιι, the
second sabbath after tlze second day ‚· and so of the rest.

“ Theg first day of the Passover is called the sabbath 3 and
they eounted after that 5³37& ΓΞΠἾἿῺΠ ΠἾΠΞῙΒ ζ”ῑζζγ seven
