118 Hebrew and T almuclical [Oh xi. 33, &a

There is much more of this kind, but thus much may suffice
for riddles.

Ver. 3 3 : Οὐδεὶς δὲ λύχνον ἅψας, &e. No mem, when lae laath
liqkted a eandle, ἀει] The coherenee of this passage with
what went before seems a little diffieult, but the connection
probably is this: there were some that had reviled him as
if he had east out devils by the prinee of the devils, others
that had required a sign from heaven, ver. 15, 16. To the
former of these he gives an ansxver, ver. 17, 18 ; and, indeed,
to both of them, ver. 19, and so on. This passage we are
upon respeots both, but the latter more principally: q. d.
“ You require a sign of ine: would you have me light a,

bring such a mind along with thee, but a candid, benign,
gentle mind; then thou wilt be all bright aud clear thyself,
andall things will be bright and clear to thee. If you had
but such a mind, Ο ye carping, blasphemous Jews, you
would not frame so sordid and infamous a judgment of my
miracles; but you would have a clear and candid opinion
concerning them.”

Ver. 38: “Ort οὐ πρῶτον ἐβαπτίσθη πρὸ τοῦ ἀρίστου· T leat lte

washed before dinner, in that sense wherein βαπτίζεσθαι signi-
