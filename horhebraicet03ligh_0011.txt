VEB. Ι : Ἐπειδήπερ πολλοὶ ἐπεχείρησαν, 856] Forasmzcch„ as
many have taken in hand, ᾆσ] Whereas it was several years
after the ascension of our Lord before the four books of the
holy gospel were committed to writing3 the apostleS‚ the
seventy disciples, and other ministers of the word, in the mean
time everywhere dispersing the glad tidings: no wonder if
any pious and greedy auditors had, for their own memory's
sake and the good of others, noted in their own private table-
books as much as they were capable of carrying from the
sermons and disoourses which they so frequently heard. Nor
is it more strange if some of these should from their own ool-
lections compile and publish now and then some commentaries
or short histories of the passages they had met with, Which,
however they might perform out of very good intentions, and
a faithful impartial pen, yet were these writings far from
commencing an infallible canon, or eternal unalterable rule of
the Christian saith.

It was not in the power of this kind of writers either to
select what the Divine Wisdom would have selected for the
holy canon, or to declare those things in that style wherein
the Holy Spirit would have them declared, to whom 116 was
neither the guide in the action nor the director of their pen.
