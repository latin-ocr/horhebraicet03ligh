probably not only some, but, in a manner, all that stood there
lived till that time. His coming] therefore, in this place,
must be understood of his coming to take vongeance against
those enemies of his which would not have him to rule over
them, as Luke xix, 12, 27.

Perhaps it will not repent him that reads the Holy Scrip-
tures to observe these few things :

I. That f the destruction of Jerusalem and the whole
J ewish state is described as if the whole frame of this world
were to be dissolved. Nor is it strange, when Grod destroyed
his habitation and city, places once so dear to him, with so
direful and sad an overthr0w3 his own people, whom he ac-
countecl of as much or more than the whole world beside,
by so dreadful and amazing plagues. Matt. xxiv. 29, 30,
“ The sun shall be darkened‚ &c. Then shall appear the
“ sign of the Son of man,’' &03 which yet are said to fall out
within that generation, ver. 34. 2 Pet. iii. 10, “ The heavens
shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall
melt with fervent heat,” &a Compare with this Deut. xxxii.
22, Heb. xii. 26: and observo that by elements are under-
stood the Mosaic elements, Gal. iv. 9, Coloss. ii. 20: and you
will not doubt that St. Peter speaks only of the conflagration
of Jerusalem, the destruction of the nation‚ and the abolishing
the dispensation of Moses.

Rev. vi. 12, 143 “The sun became black as sackcloth of
hair, &a and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is
rolled together,’' (ξω. Where, if we take notice of the fore-
going plagues, by which, according to the most frequent
threatenings, he destroyed that people, viz. the sword, ver. 4,
famine, ver. 5, 6, and the plague, ver. 8 ς withal comparing
those words, “ Then shall they begin to say to the mountains‚
Fall on us3 and to the hills, Cover uS,’' with Luke xxiii. 303
it will sufficiently appear, that by those phrases is understoodg
the dreadful judgment and overthrow of that nation and city.
With these also agrees that of J er. iv, from ver. 22 to 28, and
clearly enough explains this phrase. To this appertain those
and other such expressions as we meet with, 1 Cor. x. 11,

“ On us the ends of the world arc come ;'' and 1 Pet. iv. 7,
“⁶ The end of all things is at hand.''
