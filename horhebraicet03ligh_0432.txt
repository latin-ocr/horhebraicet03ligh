426 Hebraeo <md Talmudical [Oh. xviii. 31.

“When they saw the number of murderers so greatly increase,
that they could not sit in judgment upon them, they said,
‘ Let us remove,’ ’² Suc.

So in the case of adultery, which we also observed in our
notes upon chap. viii. ‘⁶ Since¹ them time that adultery so
openly advanced under the second Temple, they left off trying
the adulteress by the bitter water,’' Sto.

So that we see the liberty of judging in capital matters
was no more taken from the Jews by the Romans than the
beheading of the heifer or the trial of the suspected wife by
the bitter waters was taken away by them; which no one will
affirm. But rather,

ΙΙΙ. Whenn the Sanhedrim saw that it was in vain to
struggle against the mighty torrent and inundation of all
manner of wickedness, that played remo and encroached so
fast upon them, and that the interposure of their authority
could do nothing in suppressing them, they being incapable
of passing judgment as they ought, they determine not to sit
in judgment at all. And whereas they thought themselves
bound by the majesty and awfulness of the place, while they
sat in the room Gazitlz [in the very Gourt of Israel before the
altar]‚ to judge according to the sacredness of the place, but
could not indeed do it by reason of the daring pride and
resolution of the criminals, they threw themselves out of
that apartment, and went further off into the place where
the exchangers’ shops were kept in the Gourt of the Gentiles,
and so to other places, which we find mentioned in Rosk
ΙιαεΙιαηαΙιΡ. .

IV. It is disputed whether they ever returned to their first
place Gazitlb, or no. It is affirmed by the Gloss in Avodah
Zarakq: “ When for a time they found it absolutely necessary,
they betook themselves again to that room.'' We have the
same also elsewhere upon this tradition:
