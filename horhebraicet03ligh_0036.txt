And well may Christ indeed in this sense be said to be the
ἀνατολὴ ἐξ ὕψους, the branck [or spriny] from οη hiyh, in oppo-
sition to that bruach from below, by which mankind was un-
done, viz, the forbidden tree in paradise.

Ver. 80: Ἐν ταῖς ἐρήμοις· In the deserta] VVhether John
was an eremite in the sense as it is now commonly taken, we
may inquire and judge by these two things: I. Whether
there was ever any eremite in this sense among the Jews.
II. Whether he absented himself from the synagogues3 and
whether he did not present himself at Jerusalem in thef
feasts: and to this may be added, whether he retired and
withdrew himself from the society of mankind. If he ab·
sented from the synagogues, he must have been accounted
y'i 1217.) a wicked ozeigzhbome: If from the seasts, he trans-
gressed the command, Exod. xxiii. 17. If from the society
of mankind, what agreeableness was there in this? It seems
very incongruous, that he that was born for this end, “ to
turn the disobedient,” &c should withdraw himself from all
society and converse with them. Nothing would persuade
me sooner that John was indeed an anchoret, than that which
he himself saith, that he did not know Jesus, John i.31‚
whereas he was so very near akin to him. One might think,
surely he must have lain hid in some den or cave of the earth,
when, for the space of almost thirty years wherein he had
lived, he had had no society with Jesus, so near a kinsman
of his, nay, not so much as in the least to know him. But if
this were so, how came he to know and so humbly refuse him,
when he offered himself to be baptized by him? Matt. iii. 143
and this before he was instructed who he was, by the descent
of the Holy Ghost upon him? John i. 33.

From this question may arise two more :—

Ι. Whether John appeared or acted under the notion of a
prophet before his entrance into the thirtieth year of his age.
I am apt to think he did not ε and hence 1 suppose it is said
concerning him, “that he was in the deserts;'’ that is, he
was amongst the rustics, and common rank of men, as a man
of no note or quality himself, till he made himself public
under the notion and authority of a prophet.

II. Whether he might not well know his kinsman Jesus
