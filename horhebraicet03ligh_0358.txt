mitted to his charge, that he might look to it that no sheep
should stray out of the fold, nor any thing hurtful should get
or be let in.

Ver. 7: Ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ θύρα· Ι am the door] Pure Israelitism
among the Jews was the sold, and the door, and all things.
For if any one was of the seed of Israel, and the stock os
Abraham, it was enough (themselves being the judges) for
such a one to be made a sheep, admitted into the flock, and
be fed and nourished to etei-nal life. But in Christ’s flock the
sheep had another original, introduction, and mark.

Ver. 8: Πάντες ὅσοι πρὸ ἐμοῦ ἦλθον, κλέπται εἶσί· All that
ever came before me are tlcieves] Our Saviour speaks agreeably
with the Scripture3 where, when there is any mention of the
coming of this great Shepherd to undertake the charge of the

there were very many that assumed the name and title; but
before it hardly one. Judas the Galilean did not arx-ive to
that impudence, as you have his story in J osephus. Nor yet
Theudas, by any thing that may be gathered from the words
of Gamaliel, Acts v.

An argument of no mean force, which we may use against
the Jews, that the time when our J esus did appear was the
very time wherein the nation looked for the coming of
Messiah. For why did no‚one arrogate that name to him-
self before the coming of our J esus? Because they knew the
fore-appointed and the expected time of the Messiah was not
