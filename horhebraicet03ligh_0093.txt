II. We further observe in our notes upon John xii, that
there was a certain town near Jerusalem called Magdala, of
a very ill fame, which perhaps was Bethany itselsd 3 or be it
some other, yet might our Mary (if she was the sister of
Lazarus) not unfitly be callede Magdalene, either as she
might have lived there some time, being there married, or
have imitated the whorish customs of that place. But I am
apt to think that Bethany itself might go under the name of
Magdala„

Sto. The Targumist‚ Esth. v, reckoning up the same genea-
logy, mentions not this name, and differs in others. Only this
let us take notice of by the way, that Chusa is a name in the
family of Haman the Edomite, and this Ousa here was in
the family of Herod, who himself was of the bloodof the
Edomites.
