There is frequent mention amongst theC Talmudistsd, of
R5Ananias, ΕΠὊΠΣΠ 120, the saqan of the priests. He was
destroyed, with Rabban Simeon and Ismael, at the siege of
Jerusaleme. But I am apt to think he was that sharp and
unjust judge that St. Paul had to do with, Acts xxiii, rather
than our Annas in this place.

Why they should carry our Saviour, when they had taken
him, before Annas the sagan, sooner than to Oaiaphas the
high priest, the evangelist gives us one reason, viz, ‘⁶ because
he was father-in-law to Oaiaphas;'' under which another
reason may be deduced, viZ. that he was the older man, of
greater experience and skill in the law: for there were some-
times some high priests that were very unlearned fellows, as
may be gathered from that supposition in Jomaf; “ If the
high priest be a wise man, he expounds ; if not, they expound
to him. If he be accustomed to reading, he reads himself ς if
not, they read before him.”

But for the sayan of the priests, it was very necessary he
should be a man of learning, because his charge was about the
things and service of the Temple, and was bound to be always
assistant and present there, when the high priest was seldom
there, or conversed in those affairs.

might gain experience in the laws and rituals, and might be
the better fitted for the high priest's chair. But when it
