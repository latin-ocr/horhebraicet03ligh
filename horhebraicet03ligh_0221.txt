Oh. xxiii. 54] Exercitations upon St. Lake· 215

And from thence, perhapS, if the women at Jerusalem had
bewailed any other person as they bewailed our Saviour, that
other person might have said, “ Ye daughters of Jerusalem,
weep not for me, lest ye cut short my atonement ;” but Christ
speaks to them upon a far different account. And under
this notion they wrapped one that had been so executed‚ in
some ragged, torn, old, dirty windingsheets; that this dis-
⁷ grace, being thrown upon him, might augment his expiation.
But this good Arimathean behaves himself otherwise with
J esus, as having conceived quite another opinion concerning
him.

Ver. 54¹ : Καὶ σάββατον ἐπέφωσκε· Ami cleo sabbath droco om]
The vulgar reads, et sabbatum illucescebat‚· tho sabbath heyam,
to dawn .· not ill rendered. Beza reads, et sabbatum succedebam
and tho sabbath succeeded: not properly. One would have
thought it would have been more congruously said, Καὶ εἷς σάβ-
βατον ἐσκοτίσθη, it beyom to be dccrk towards tlte sabbath .· for ‘the
night before the sabbath was coming on : but,

I. The sabbatical candles that were lighted in honour of
the sabbath were now set up. “ There ¹¹¹ are three things
which it is necessary a man should warn those of his own
house of 011 the evening of the sabbath, when night is coming
on: Have you paid your tenths? :wamy Have you bayton your
Erublziclc society? ὊΠ ΠΝ 'tyb-ir! liylzt up your camillos*
‘² Men¹¹ and women are bound to light up a candle in their
houses upon the sabbath day. If a man hath not bread to
eat, yet he must beg from door to door to get a little oil to
set up his light.” These things being noted, the evangelist
may not be improperly understood thus, ‘⁶ The sabbath began ⁰
to shine with the lights set up ;” respect being had to these
sabbath candles. But I do not acquiesce here.

ΙΙ. The evening of the sabbath was called amongst the Jews
aas and sna-ns liyktv. -nri wis: wart-i ns *pp-n: 'r aas
By the liyht of the fourteontk day they make a search for leavm

that is, on the evening‚ or in the night that immediately precedes
that day. So Rambam upon the place, &³72 γῖΞΠΠ ΠΡἾἾΞ
