nights after this, J udas died.

Ver. 30: Εὐθέως ἐξῆλθεν· ἣν δὲ νύξ· lVent immediately out .-
aml it was niella] So the traitor goes forth to his work of
darkness under the conduct of the devil‚ the shelterf of the
night. He was to go two miles, viz. from Bethany to J eru-
sale1n; then was he to seek out and get the chief priests to-
gether, to make his bargain with them for betraying Christ.
Whether he did all this this very night 01· the day following,
as the holy Scripture saith nothing of it, so is it of no- great
moment for us to make a business of inquiring about it. It
is not so difficult to shew how many difficulties they involve
themselves in that would have all this done the very same
night wherein the paschal supper was celebrated, as it is a

perdition, had removed himself from them, he could then pro-
perly enough say, ‘⁶ Behold, I and the children which thou hast
given me.”

Ver. 38: Οὔ μὴ ἀλέκτωρ φωυήσει· The cock shall nol crow]
We must not understand this as if the cock should not crow
at all before Peter had denied Christ thrice: this had not
been true, because the cock had crowed twice before Peter
had denied him. But we must understand it, The cock shall
not have finished his crowing, 850. Nor indeed was that time
above half over before Peter had denied his Master.

Theh Jewish doctors distinguished the cockcrowing into
the first, second, and third. The first they call ἾΞἎΠ ‘mm-¹17
