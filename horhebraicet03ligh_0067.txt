gelists and apostles should follow it so exactly, and that even
in some places where it does so widely differ from the Hebrew
fountain ἕ

Ans. Ι. It pleased God to allot the censers of Korah,
Dathan, and Abiram to sacred use, because they were so
ordained and designed by the first owners : so doth it please
the Holy Ghost. to determine that version to his own use,
being so primarily ordained by the first authors. The minds,
indeed, of the interpreters were not perhaps very sincere in
the version they made, as who designed the defence and sup-
port of some odd things: so neither were the hearts of Korah,
Dathan, and Abiram sincere at all, but very perverse in
offering their incense: but so long as their incense had been
dedicated to sacred use, it pleased Grod to make their censers
holy. So the Greek version designed for sacred use, as
designed for the Holy Bible, so it was kept and made use of
by the Holy Ghost.

ΙΙ. Whereas the New Testament was to be wrote in
Greek, and come into the hands chiefly of the Gentiles, it
was most agi-eeable, I may say most necessary for them, to
follow the Greek copies, as being what the Gentiles were
only capable of consulting; that so they, examining the
histories and quotations that were brought out of the Old
Testament, might find them agreeing with, and not contra-
dicting them. For instance3 they, consulting their Greek
Bibles for the names from David backward to Adam, there
find “ Cainan, the son of Arphaxad.'’ If St. Luke should not
also have inserted it, how readily they might have called his
veracity in question, as to the other part of the genealogy,
which had been exn-acted out of tables and registers not so
familiarly known !

ΙΙΙ. If there be any credit to be given to that story of the
Greek version, which we meet wit-h in Aristeas and J osephus,
then we may also believe that passage in it which we may
find in Aristeas. Καθὼς δὲ ἀνεγνώσθη, &c. “When the
volumes of the law had been read through, the priests, and
interpretem, and elders, and governors of the city, and all
the princes of the people standing by, said, ἐπεὶ καλῶς καὶ
ὁσίως διερμηνεύεται, &e ‘ Forasmuch as this interpretation
is rightly, religiously, and in every thing so very accurately
