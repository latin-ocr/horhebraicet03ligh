292 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. v. 2.

rendere that passage, “ There was at Jerusalem ΝἾΠ &nm-1

ἃΠἾἻἹῚΞὩΌἾ a certain place of baptistery‚” that he intended
rather the washing unclean persons than beasts.

II. “Thereg was net any like to Benaiah, the son of J ehoiada,

under the second Temple. &za-turm ΠἽῖἳὶἱἾ ripn-5 &7³¹1 Nn*
nin-1 He one day struck lais fhot aqaivzst α dead cortoise, ΠΠΞἾ

³7:22³ man-r svn anri mhazflv audwent down to siloam,
where, breakiny all the little particles of hail, ke washed him-
seff ..... This was on the shortest day in winter, the tenth ef
the month Tebeth.”

I de not concern myself for the truth of this stery3 but
must take notice what he hints that telleth it3 viz. that
in such a case men were went to wash themselves in Siloam,
not the feuntain, but the peel.

“ Simeonh Sicuensis dug wells, cisterns‚ and caves in
Jerusalem. Rabban J ochanan Ben Zacchai saith to him, ‘ If
a woman should come te thee, and ask thee about her men-
strua, theu sayest to her, ΠῖΠ ἾἾΞΞ 471ῐῶ Dip thyself in this
well, fer the waters thereos will purify.'”

III. These five perches, therefore, seem te be the several
entrances by which the unclean went down into the waters
to be washed3 and in which, before washing, they might lay
up theiri clothes, and after it put them en again, being there
always protected from the rain. And perhaps they had their
different entrances and descents according to the different
sert-s ef uncleanness, that all those that were ene and the
same way defiled should have one and the same entrance and
descent into the pool. That this was the first design and use
of these perches I do not at all doubt, though afterward
there was another use for them brought in. And as to the
washing of the unclean in this pool, let me also superadd this
one remark: That when they allowed (and that ef necessity,
because of the multitudes of unclean persons) the lesser ga-
therings of waters, viz. forty seahs of water in a place fitted
en purpose both for breadth and depth, if there was no greater
plenty of water, then we must net suppose that they would
by any means neglect the ponds and peols.
