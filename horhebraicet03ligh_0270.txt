Ver. 3: Ἀπεκρίθη ὁ Ἰησοῦς, 8ῦο. Jesus answered, &ej

You may ask how this answer suits with the question that
Nicodemus put: it may appear very apposite upon this ac-
count: ‘⁶ You seem, O Nicodemus, to see some sign of the
approaching kingdom of heaven in these miracles that are
done by me. Verily, Ι say unto thee, No one can see the
kingdom of God as he ought, if he be not born ἄνωθεν, flvm
above.''
. Ἐὰν μή τις γεννηθῇ ἄνωθεν· Eoecept a mem be born aqam]
By what word our Saviour expressed ἄνωθεν in the Jewish
language, it is not easy determining3 whether by ΝῘῬὩῙἬΞ
which I indeed suppose he might, or by ζζ7“Ἶ“ῐ pa, as the Sy-

ono that will take the pains to compare them: and that by
the lcingldom of God or of lacavere, is meant the kz‘wdmn and
times of the Messiah, is so plain, that it needs no argument
to prove it.

WVhen 1, therefore, there was so vehement and universal
an expectation of the coming and reign of the Messiah
amongst the Jews, and when some token and indication of
these timesu might appear to Nicodemus in the miracles
that Christ had wrought, our Saviour instructs him by what
way and means he may be made apt and capable for seeing
and entering into this kingdom, and enjoying the benefits
and advantages of Messiah's days. For,
