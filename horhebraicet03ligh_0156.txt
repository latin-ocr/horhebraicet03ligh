ought not to be passed by without observation, that Christ
was at such a dinner, and that in the house of a Pharisee‚
who doubtless was observant enough of all ceremonies of this
kind.

Ver. 3: Εἰ ἔξεστι τῷ σαββάτῳ θεραπεύειυ; IS it Zauffichl to
keal on the sabbath day 2] A J ew will be ready to cavil
against the truth of the evangelists upon the occasion of this
and such like questions they report from our Saviour. What
need had he (will such a one say) to ask this question, when
he could not but know that, in danger of life, it was per-
mitted them to do any thing towards the preservation of it.
Nay, where there was no imminent danger, they were allowed
to apply medicines, plasters, &c.; especially, which I must not
omit, rme: WDT‘I ΠἻίἶἯ ΓΞΓΠΞ &nanu to αἰθρίῃ Zeaven even
in tlze time of Passorer to α ⁶ Gumretlaa ξ’ some very burning
distemper.

This is all true indeed; and this no doubt our Saviour un—
derstood well enough: but withal he could not but observe
with how ill an eye they looked at him, and would not allow
that in him which was lawful in another man. He was always
accused for healing on the sabbath day, which whiles he did
with a word speaking, he could not violate the sabbath so
much asg even their own canons permitted him: and where-
fore then should they accuse him? In mere hatred to his
person and actions. There are two little stories we meet with
in places quoted before, which perhaps may serve in some
measure to illustrate this matter.

‘⁴ The grandchild of R. J oshua Ben Levi had some disease
in his throat„ &wne 3³- ηψπ-τ rviam ΓΜ) πυτ-1171 -ιΠ >ms

name ofJesus the son of Pandira, aad ke was restored.’⁷ Here we
see the virtue and operation of J esus not so utterly exploded,
but they did allow of it.

‘¹ When R. Eliezer Ben Damah had been bitten with a ser-
pent, and J acobus Oapharsamensis came in the name of J esus
the son of Pandira to heal him, R. Ismael forbade it.'’ And
so the sick man died.
