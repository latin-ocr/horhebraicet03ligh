Temple and religion being restored to them: the continuance
of the feast for eight days was instituted in commemoration ’
of that miracle: both by the direction of the scribes, when
there was not so much as one prophet throughout the whole
land.

“ Therek were eighty-five elders‚ above thirty of which were
prophets too, that made their exceptione against the feast of
Purim, ordained by Esther and Mordecai, as some kind of
innovation against the law.’' And yet that feast was but to
be of two days' continuance. It is a wonder then how this
feast ofDedz'cate'on, the solemnity of which was to be kept up
- for eight days together, that had no other foundation of au-
thority but that of the scribes, should be so easily swallowed
by them.

J osephus, as also the Book of Maccabees, tells us, that this
was done about the hundred and forty—eighth year of the
Seleucidae: and at that time, nay, a great while before, the
doctrine of traditions and authority of the traditional scribes
had got a mighty sway in that nation. So that every decree
of the Sanhedrim was received as omeular, nor was there any
the least grudge or complaint against it. So that, though the
traditional masters could not vindicate the institution of such
a feast from any tradition exhibited to Moses upon mount
Sinai, yet might they invent something as traditional to prove
the lawfulness of such an institution.

Who had the presidency in the Sanhedrim at this time
cannot be certainly determined. That which is told of J oshua
Ben Perachiah, how he fied from J anneus the kingl, carries
some probability along with it, that J oses Ben J oezer of Ze-
medai, and J oses Ben Jochanan of Jerusalem, to whom J oshua
Ben Perachiah and Nittai the Arbelite succeeded in their
chairs, sat president and vice-president at that time in the
Sanhedrim. But this is not of much weight, that we should
tire ourselves in such an inquiry.
