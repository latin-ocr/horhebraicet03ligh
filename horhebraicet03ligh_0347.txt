Oh. ix. 6] Emer-citatiores upon St..solm. 341

time of its first coming? ‘ Then,' saith Antoninus, ‘ it will kick
in the mother's womb and rush out.' The Rabbi saith, ⁸ This Ι
learned of Antoninus; and the scripture seems to back it
when it saith, Sin lieth at the door? ”

It appears from this dispute, whether true or seigned, that
the ancient opinion of the Jews was, that the infant, from its
first quickening, had some stain of sin upon it. And that
great doctor, R. J udah the Holy, was originally of that opinion
himself, but had lightly changed his mind upon so paltry an
argument. Nay, they went a little further, not only that the
infant might have some stain of sin in the womb, but that it
might, in some measure, actually sin, and (lo that which might
render it- criminal. To which purpose this passage of the dis-
ciples seems to have some relation; “ Did this man sin, that
he was born blind ἓ” That is, Did he, when his mother carried
him in her womb, do any foul or enormous thing that might
deserve this severe stroke upon him, that he should bring this
blindness with him into the world?

Ver. 6: Ἔπτυσε χαμαί· He spat on tlte ground, &⁶.] I. How
far spittle was accounted wholesome for weak eyes, we may
learn from this ridiculous tale ε

“ R. Meirr sat, and was teaching in the evening of the sab-
bat-h day. There was a woman stood by hearing him preach3
after he had done she went home and found her candle gone
out, Her husband saith to her, ⁶ VVhere hast thou been ’ζ’ ‘ Ι
have been,' saith she, ‘ standing and hearing the voice of a
preacher.7 Her husband saith to her, ‘ Thou shalt not enter in
till thou hast gone and spat in the face of him that taught?
After three weeks, her neighbouring women persuading and
heartening her to it, she goes to the chapel. Now the whole
matter was already made known to R. Meir. He saith there-

‘ Is there ever α woman amony glou skilced in mutterz'ny charms
over φῶθ’ [for he feigned a grievous ailment in his eyes 1]
The woman said, ‘ R„ Ι am skilled ε’ “Ηοκνθνρι·,” saith he, ‘ do
you spit seven times upon my eyes, and Ι shall be healed ςἼ which
she dicis Gloss ; “ Whenever they muttered any charms
over the eyes, it was necessary that they should spit upon
them.”
