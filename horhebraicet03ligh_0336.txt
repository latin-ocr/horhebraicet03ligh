of the sanctuary3 which when he had infused into the water,
he was to give the woman to drink: he was to write also in a
book the curses or adjurations that were to be pronouneed
upon her, Numb. v. 17, 23. In like manner our Saviour
stoops down 3 and making the floor itself his book, he writes
something in the dust, doubtless against these accusers whom
he was resolved to try, in analogy to those ourses and adju-
rations written in a book by the priest, against the woman
that was to be tried.

IV. The priest after he had written these ourses in a book
blots them out with the bitter water, Numb. v. 23. For the

The question is, whether the woman was guilty or not?
If guilty, behold the eurses writ against her: if not guilty,
then behold they are blotted out. But Christ was assured‚

does not write and blot out, but writes and writes again.

V. He imitates the gesture of the priest, if it be true what
the Jews report concerning it, and it is not unlikely‚ viz.
that 116 first pronouneed the eurses3 then made the woman
drinl{; and after she had dmuk, pronounced the same curses
again. So Christ first stoops down and writes; then makes
them as it were drink, in that searching refiection of his,
“ He that is without sin among you ;’' and then stoops down
again and writes upon the earth.

shame these wieked men before the common people: and
therefore adds that peeuliar force and energy to what he said·
that they could not stand it out, but with shame and confu-
sion drawing off and retiring‚ they confess their guilt before
the whole crowd. A thing little less than miracle.
