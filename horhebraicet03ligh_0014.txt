Theophilus amongst the Jews, at that very time, probably, s
when St. Luke wrote his Gospel, but I do not think this
was he. J osephus mentions himg3 ‘⁴ King Agrippa, re-
moving J esus the son of Gamaliel from the high priesthood,
ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν Ματθίᾳ τῷ Θεοφίλου, plave it to Matthias the son of
Theophilus : καθ’ ὃν ὁ πρὸς Ῥωμαίους πόλεμος Ἰουδαίοις ἔλαβε

Ver. 5: Ἐξ ἐφημερίας Ἀβιά· Of the course of Abia] They
are very little versed in the Holy Scriptures, and less in the
J ewish learning, that could imagine this Zacharias to have
been the high priest, when he is said to have been but of the
eighth course, and to have attained this turn of attendance
by lot.

As to the institution of the courses under the first Temple,
there is no need to say anything, because every one hath it

The prophets, who were conversant amongst them at that
time, obliged them, that if Jehoiarib himself should come up
from the captivity, that he should not thrust out the course
that preceded him, but be, as it were, an appendix to it.
The prophets come forth, and cast in four-and-twenty lots
into the urn3 J edaiah comes, and having drawn five, himself
was the sixth. Harim comes, and having drawn five, himself
was the sixth. Pashur comes, and having drawn five, himself
was the sixth. Immer comes, and having drawn five, himself
was the sixth. It was agreed amongst them that if J ehoiarib
himself should return out of captivity, he should not exclude
the foregoing course, but be, as it were, an appendix to it.
The heads of the courses stand forth, and divide themselves
into the houses of their fathers? Sto. We have the same
thing in Babyl. Eraclzim fol. 12. 2.

If these things be true (and, indeed, by comparing them
