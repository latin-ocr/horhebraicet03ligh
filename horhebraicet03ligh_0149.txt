Oh. xiii. 23‚32.] [ivm-citatam upon st. Lake. 143

Ver. 23: Εἰ ὀλίγοι οἱ σωζόμευοις Are there few that be
saved .?] This question, Lord, are there few that be saved?
when it was a received opinion amongst the Jews, ⁶ that all
Israel should have their part in the world to eome‚' makes
it doubtful whether it was propounded captiously‚ or merely
for satisfaction.

Thish very matter is disputed amongst the Masters.
“ Thereforei hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her
mouth D'll'l'dfflzt? beyond the statute [without measure, A. V.].
Reshk Lachish saith, ‘ This is for him who forsaketh one
statute.’ (The Grloss is, ‘ He that leaves one statute unob-
served shall be condemned in hell.') But R. Jochanan saith,
‘ Their Lord will not have it so as thou sayest concerning
them.' (The Gloss is, ⁶ He will not have thee judge so con-
cerning Israelff) For the sense is, Although a man have
learned but one statute only, he shall escape hell. It is said,
‘ Itl shall come to pass that in all the land, saith the Lord,
two parts of it shall be cut off and die, and the third part
shall be left) Resh Lachish saith, ‘ The third part of Shem.’
R. J ochanan saith unto him, ‘ Their Lord will not have it so
as thou sayest concerning them, for it is the third part of
Noah.' [t is said, ‘I will take you one of a city and two of
a tribe ms Resh Lachish saith, ‘These words are to be under-
stood in the very lette1·.' R. Jochanan saith unto him,
‘ Their Lord will not have it so as thou sayest concerning
them, but one of a city shall expiate for the whole city, and
two of a family for the whole family. It is said, ⁶ I will take
them for my people3' and it is said, ‘I will bring you into
the land.' He compares their going out of the land of Egypt
with their coming in to their own land: now how was their
coming in into the land of Ganaan? There were only two
persons of threescore myriads that entered it. Rabba saith,
So also shall it be in the days of the Messiahf '' A man
would hardly have expected such ingenuity from a J ew as we
here meet with in Resh Lachish and Babba.
