372 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xi. 51.

Priest and Bishop of souls, “ that he should die for the
people,’' &Q

That of the apostle, Acts xxiii. 5, “ Ι wist not that he was
the high priest,” may perhaps have some such meaning as
this in it, “I knew not that there was any high priest at
all ;'’ because the office had become needless for some time.
For grant indeed that St.. Paul did not know the face of
Ananias, nor that Ananias was the high priest, yet he must
needs know him to have been a magistrate, because he had
his seat amongst the fathers of the Sanhedrim. Now those
words which he quoted out of the law, “ Thou shalt not speak
evil of the ruler of thy people‚'' forbade all indecent speeches
towards any magistrate, as well as the high priest. The
apostle, therefore, knowing Ananias well enough, both who he
was, and that he sat there under a falsely assumed title of the
high priest, does on purpose call him ‘whited wall,' because
he only bore the colour of the high priesthood, when as the
thing and office itself was now abolished.

Caiaphas, in this passage before us, speaketh partly as
Oaiaphas and partly as a prophet. As Oaiaphas‚ he does,
by an impious and precipitate boldness, contrive and promote
the death of Christ: and what he uttered as a prophet, the
evangelist tells ue, he did it not of himself ; he spoke what
himself understood not the depth of.

The greatest work of the Messiah‚ according to the expec-

tation of the Jews, was ΠἸἿῙἋΠ namn οι· ΠἹὛῙὮΖῙΠ ΠΞἿῦζή

the reductiora or qatlcerinq toyetlaer the captivitieS. The high ’

priest despairs that ever J esus, should he live, could do this.
For all that he either did orl taught seemed to have a con-
trary tendency, viz. to seduce the people from their religion,
rather than recover them from their servile state of bondage.
So that he apprehended this one only remedy left, that care
might be taken, so as by the death of this man the hazard of
that nation's ruin might blow over: “ If he be the Messiah
(which Ι almost think even Oaiaphas himself did not much
question), since he can have no hope of redeeming the

nation, let him die for it himself, that it perish not upon
his account.''
