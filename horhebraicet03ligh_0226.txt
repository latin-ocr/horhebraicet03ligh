220 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xxiv. 30.

there abode we in tents three days, Ezra viii, ι 5. It is written
also of the third day of the resurrection from the dead, After
two days will he revive ηε, and the third day he will raise us
up. It is written also of the third doc-y of Esther, And on the
third day Esther put on her royal apparel, Esther v. 1. The
Targumist adds, ΝΠΟΞἾ ΠΝΠἺῖῬΠ ΝῩΞἾἮ οη the third day
of the Passover.'' And that indeed is the day we are at pre-
sent concerned in, namely, the third day of the Passover. If
these things were taken so much notice of concerning the
third day, at that time, in the schools and synagogues, (as I see
no reason why it should be denied,) then these words of
Cleopas may seem to look a little that way, as speaking ac-
cording to the vulgar conceptions of the Jews. For whereas
it had been plain enough to have said, τρίτην τὴν ἡμέραν ἄγει
σήμερον, to dags is the third day, but he further adds, σὺν πᾶσι
τούτοις, beside all this, and the word ταύτην, this, t003 there
seems a peculiar force in that addition, and an emphasis in
that word. As if the meaning of it were this: “ That- same
J esus was mighty in word and deed, and shewed himself such
a one, that we conceived him the true Messiah, and him that
was to redeem Israel : and besides all these things which
bear witness for him to be such, this very day bears witness
also. For whereas there is so great an observation amongst
us concerning the third day, this is the third day since he was
crucified; and there are some women amongst us, that say
they have been told by angels that he is risen again.''

Ver. 30: Λαβὼν τὸν ἄρτον εὐλόγησε, &c He took broad, and
blessed it, gra] It is strange that any should expound this
breaking of bread of the holy eucharist, when Christ had
determined with himself to disappear in the very distribution
of the bread and so interrupt the supper. And where indeed
doth it appear that any of them tasted a bit? For the supper
was ended before it began. -

’ἺᾸἸ Ἰῖἳῧξήζυ Πωίῗω “ If h three eat toffether, they are bound
to say grace ;” that is, as it is afterward explained, “ One of
them saith, ‘ Let us bless ε’ but if there be three and himself,
then he saith, ‘ Bless yei) '' Although I do not believe Christ
tiedk himself exactly to that custom of saying, ‘ Let us bless3'
