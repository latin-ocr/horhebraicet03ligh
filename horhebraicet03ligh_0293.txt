street, no, not with his own wife⁵.”

Ver. 28 : Ἀφῆκευ οὖν τὴν ὑδρίαν· Left her wedewei] It was
kindly done to leave her ‘cc-aterpot behind her; that J esus and

thing agree with the Jewish notion about their Messiah's
smelling :

“ Itt is written, ’Π Πζξῖᾝῖᾏ ἤΠἾἾζῘ] And lae shall ¹make him

saith, He shall be of quick scent, and shall judge, as it is

Coziba reigned two years and a half, and said to the Rabbins,
‘ I am the Messiah.' They say unto him, ‘ It is said of the
Messiah, that he shall be of quick scent and shall judge : let
us see if you can smell and judge :' which when he could not
do, they killed him.”

The Samaritan woman perceived that J esus had smelt out
all her clandestine wickednesses, which she had perpetrated
out of the view of men; for which very reason she argued it
with herself, that this must be the Messiah. And by her
report her fellow-citizens are encouraged to come and see
him. They see him, hear him, invite him, receive and enter-
tain him, and believe in him. Is it not probable, therefore,
