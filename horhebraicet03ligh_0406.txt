Ver. 81³: Δεῖξον ἡμῖν τὸν πατέρα, καὶ ἀρκεῖ ἡμῖν· LS'laew us the
Father, and it sufficeth us] ‘⁶ When the law was given to
Moses the Israelites saw God in his glory: do thou, there-
fore, now that thou art bringing in a new law and economy
amongst US‚ do thou show us the Father, and his glory‚
and it will suffice us‚· so that we will have no more doubt
about it.”

Ver. 16: ’Άλλον παράκλητου δώσει ὑμῖν· He shall §live you
another· Comforter] Although the word 103737725) is in frequent
use amongst the Jews to signify cm advocate, and that very

at present. For,

Ι. Amongst all the names and titles given to the Messiah
in the Jewish writers, that of Menalzem, or the O'omforter‚
hath chiefly obtained3 and the days of the Messiah amongst
thern are styled the days of ‘ consolation? The names of
Messiah are reckoned upq, viz. Shiloh, Jinnon, Chaninah,
Menahem. And in Jerusalem *Beracf we are told how the
Messiah had been born in Bethlehem under the name of
Menalcan.

Luke ii. 25 ς “waiting for the consolation of Israel.’'
Targumist upon Jer. xxxi. 6 : “ Those that desire or long for
the years of consolation to come.'' This they were Wont t0
swear by, viz. the desire they had of seeing this consolation.
ΠὩΠΠΞ ΠΝἾΝ So let me seo tlte consolation.

Now, therefore, bring these words of our Saviour to what
hath been said: q. d. “ Yon expect, with the rest os this
namon, the consolation in the Messiah and in his presence.
W 0113 I must depart, and withdraw my presence from you;
bnt I will send you in my stead ‘ another Oonfforter.’ '³
