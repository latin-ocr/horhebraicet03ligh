Ch. v. 4} Eoeercz'tations ‘upon St. John. 293

Ver. 4: ’Ἄγγελος γὰρ κατὰ καιρὸν κατέβαινεν· An anqel went
down at a certain samsom] It is hardly imaginable that these
impotent people lay day and night throughout the whole year
at this pool. It seems rather that the troubling of the waters
and healing the sick was usual only at the solemn feasts,
probably only the feast of the Passover. And so it may not
be amiss to interpret the κατὰ καιρὸν with this restriction‚ ‘⁴ It
was a feast of the Jews, and an angel went down at that certain
season into the pool‚'’ &a

Καὶ ἐτάρασσε τὸ ὕδωρ· And troubled the water] We have
this story, or rather this tale, concerning a certain fountain
troubled by an evil angel: ‘⁴ Itk is a story in our city con-
cerning Abba J oses (saith R. Berechiah in the name of R.
Simeon), that when he sat at the fountain and required some-
thing, there appeared to him the spirit that resided there,
and said, ‘ You know well enough how many years I have
dwelt in this place, and how yourselves and your wives have
come and returned without any damage done to you, But
now you must knOW, that an evil spirit endeavours to supply
my room, who would prove very mischievous amongst you.'
He saith to him, ⁶ What must we do then ζ’ He answered him
and said, ‘ Go and tell the townspeople, that whoever hath¹ a
hammer and an iron pin or bolt, let him come hither to-
morrow morning, and have his eyes intent upon the waters3
&³⁵07 ΝἾἾΞἹΞἻὩ ΓἺΞΠ ἶἹΞἾΝ ἿΞἸ and when you see the
waters troubled, then let them knock with the iron, and say,
³72: ᾏἿἿἾ “ The victory is ours :³² and so let them not go back,
tin they see swa ses ἓν sxa-rr swan-1 miok drops 0f blood
upon the face of the waters! '³ The Gloss is: “ By this sign it
will appear that the spirit was conquered and killed.'' And
the rest of the legend tells us that they did as was commanded,
and did not depart till they saw the thick drops of blood
upon the waters. Let them enjoy themselves in their doughty
victory.

When the time was not afar off wherein ‘⁶ there should be a
fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness‚“' Zech. xiii. 1,
viz, the fountain of the blood of Ohrist; Divine Providence
would have it, that a thing of that inconceivable excellency
