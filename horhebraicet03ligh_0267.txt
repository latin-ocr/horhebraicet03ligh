Ch. iii. 1.] Exeroitations upon St. John. 261

These and. other things they apologize for their Temple3
adding this invention for the greater honour of the thing—
that all that space of time wherein it was a building, it
never once rained by day, that the work might not be inter-
ruptedh.

The Rabbins take a great deal of pains, but to no purpose,
upon those words, Hagg. ii. 9, “ The glory of this latter house
shall be greater than of the former.’' “ R. Jochanani and R.
Eliezer say; one, that it was greater sor the fabric ; the
other, that it was greater for the duration.’' As if the glory
of the Temple consisted in any mathematical reasons of space,
dimension, or duration3 as if it lay in walls, gilding, or orna-
ment. The glory of the first Temple was the Ark, the divine
cloud over the Ark, the Urim and the Thummim, &c. Now
where or in what can consist the greater ylory of the second
Temple when these are gone?

Herein it is indeed that the Lord of the Temple was him-
self present in his Temple: he himself was present ἐν ᾦ κατοι-
κεῖ πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς θεότητος σωματικῶς· in ‘bokom dwelletk
all thefulrzess of the Godlwad bodily, Coloss. ii. 9 ; as the divine
glory of old was over the ark τυπικῶς, typicallys, or by way of
shadow only.

This is the glory, when he himself is present who is the
great High Priest and the Prophet3 who, answerably to the
Urim and Thummim of old, reveals the counsels and will of
G0d3 he who is the true and living Temple, whom that Tem-
ple shadowed out. “ This Temple of yours, O ye Jews, does
not answer its first pattern and exemplar: there are wanting
in that, what were the chief glory of the former3 which very
defect intimates that there is another Temple to be expected,
that in all things may fall in with its first type, as it is
necessary the antitype should do, And this is the Temple of
my body.” No further did he think fit to reply to them at
that time.
