writings of the prophetS, or that they accounted them tales
and of no value? There were some amongst the Samaritans,
as Eulogius in Photiusc tells US, who had an opinion, that
“ J oshua the son of Nun was that prophet of whom Moses
spake, that God would raise up to them out of their brethren
like to him.’⁷ Do we think then that the history and Book
of J oshua were unknown or disowned by them? However, I
cannot omit, without some remarks, some few passages we
meet with in Sanlaedriwz, fol. 90. 2 :
