of it broken‚· but that of the daily sacrifice was broken and
cut into several parts; and yet they are both of them the
body of Christ in a figure. And although, besides the break-
ing] of it, there are these further instances wherein the Pas-
chal lamb and that of the daily sacrifice did differ, viz„ 1.
that the daily sacrifice was for all Israel, but the Paschal for
this or that family: 2. the daily sacrifice was for the atone-
ment of sin ; the Passover not so : 3. the daily sacrifice was
burnt‚ but the Passover eaten τ yet in this they agreed, that
under both the body of our Saviour was figured and shadowed
out, though in a different notion.

over in remembrance of your going out of Egypt. “Thoue
shalt remember the day of thy going out of Egypt all the
days of thy life. Ben Zuma thus explains it; The days of

should be remembered. We suspect in our notes upon 1 Gor.

of the holy eucharist, did so far J udaize, that what had been
instituted for the commemoration of their redemption by the
death of Christ, they perverted to the commemoration of the
going out of Egypt3 and that they did not at all ‘ discern the
Lord’s body’ in the sacrament.

Under the law there were several eatings of holy things.
The first was that which Sv‘pkra mentionsf‚ 0⁵37th ΒὉΠΞ
ΕἾἾΞΞΠΌ ΕἿῙῚῺΞἹ when the priests eat of the sacrifice, and
atonement is made for kim that himin-as it. There were other
eatings, viz, of the festival sacrifices of the tenths, thanks-
giving-offerings, δια, which were to be eaten by those that
brought them ; but these all now have theirg period: and
