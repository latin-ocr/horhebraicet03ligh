Chii. 570] Emercitations upon St. John. 249

at the end of Acen [i. e. the Crospel] that it is written there,

law of Moses ε’ ” where he abuseth both the name of our
Saviour and his words too, Matt. v. 17.

And¹ now, after our just detestation of this execrable
blasphemy, let us think what kind of judge this must be, to
whose judgment Rabban Gamaliel, the president of the San-
hedrim, and his sister, wife to the great Eliezer‚ should be-
