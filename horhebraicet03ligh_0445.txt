Oh. xix. 34] Exmvitations upon Sc. Jolm. 439

,bath day they reaped the sheaf only to the measure of one
seah, with one sickle, in one basket ε’ but upon a common day
they reaped three seahs, with three sickles, in three baskets.
But. the wise men say, ‘ The sabbath days and other days as
to this matter are alike.'”

III. This night they were to lodge in Jerusalem, or in
booths about, so near the city that they might not exceed the
bounds of a sabbath day's journey.''

In the morning, again, they met very early in the court, as
the day before, and the sacrifices are brought for the people's
appearing before the Lord : the sheafof first fruits is offered

of the thing as we see he doth ς “And he that saw it bare

testament, water and blood, flowed out of this wound: but I
would rather say that the antitype of the old testament
might be here seen.

I. The apostle teacheth us that the ratification of the old
