with which also the French agrees, Bessusoiteront avec mon
σονιυες They shall riso with my body. But it is properly,
Corpus meum resument,- They shall oar-ise my body: so the
Interlineary version. “ The Gentiles being dead in their sins

the devil. For,

seed of the woman, mentioned Gen. iii. 15, about the glory of
God and the salvation of man. In which strife and contest
we need not doubt but the devil would exert all his malice and
force to the very uttermost.

II. God loosed all the reins, and suffered the devil without
any kind of restraint upon him to exercise his power and
