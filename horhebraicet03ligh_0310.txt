ful for the workmen to eat of those things wherein he worketh ;
a melon, to the value of a penny; and dates, to the value of
a penny,'' 810.

Compare these passages with what our Saviour speaks;
“Labour (saith he) for that meat which endureth to ever-
lasting life.” Now, what is that work of God which we should
do, that might entitle us to eat of that food? Believe in
Christ, and ye shall feed on him.

Ver. 31¹‘z Οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν τὸ μάννα ἔφαγον· Oui-fathers did
eat manna] I. They seek a sign of him worthy the Messiah;
and in general they seem to look towards those dainties which
that nation fondly dreamed their Messiah would bring along
with him when he should come3 but more particularly they
expect manna.

‘⁴ Y e seek me (saith our Saviour), not because ye did see
the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were
filled.'' VVere all these so very poor that they had need to
live at another nian’s charge? or should follow Christ merely
for bread3 It is possible they might expect other kind of
daintics‚ according to the vain musings of that nation. Per-
haps he was such a kind of slave to his belly that said,
·'‘ Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God,''
Luke xiv. 15.

‘⁶ ManyS affirm that the hope of Israel is, that Messiah
shall come and raise the dead3 and they shall be gathered
together in the garden of Eden, and shall eat and drink, and
satiate themselves all the days of the world . . . . and that
there are houses built of precious stenes, beds of silk, and
rivers flowing with wine and spicy 011.” “ Het made manna
to descend for them, in which were all manner of tastes ; and
every Israelite found in it what his palate was chiefly pleased
with. If he desired fat in it, he had it. In it the young men
tasted bread, the old men honey, and the children oil . . . . So
it shall be in the world to come [the days of the Messias]:
he shall give Israel peace, and they shall sit down and eat in
the garden of Edem and all nations shall behold their con-
dition; as it is said, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye
shall be hungry‚ Isa. lxv. 13.''
