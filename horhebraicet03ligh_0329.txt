Because thence they draw the H oly Spi1·it.” Gloss in Succaln,
ubi supr.: “In the Jerusalem Talmud it is expounded, that
they draw there the Holy spirit, fora divine breathing is upon
the man through joy.'’

Another Gloss: nm ivam “ Tlceflzote also somzded for in-
crease of the joy.’' Drawing of water, therefore, took its rise
from the words of Isaiah ε they rejoiced over the waters as a
symbol and figure of the law; and they looked for the holy
Spirit upon this joy of theirs.

ΙΙΙ. But still they add further¹: “Why doth the law
command, saying‚ Offer ye water on the feast of Tabernacles?
The holy blessed God saith, Offer ye waters before me on
the feast of TabernacleS, '172127 *mvl 0:³7 wanww ⁸7: t

The Jews aeknowledge that the latter Redeemer is to '.
procure water for them, as their formern redeemer Moses ι
had done0. But as to the true meaning of this, they are ³
very blind and ignorant, and might be better taught by the
Messiah here, if they had any mind to learn.

Ι. Our Saviour calls them to a belief in him from their
own boast and glorying in the law: and therefore Ι rather
think those words, καθὼς εἶπεν ἡ γραφὴ, as the Scriptura ham
said, should relate to the foregoing clause, “ Whosoever be-
lieveth in me, as the Scripture hath spoken about believing‚
