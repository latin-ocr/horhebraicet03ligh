reader may a little wonder at:

sense is; He is not admitted to be a judge οι· witness for
him all that time, wherein for certain days of the nuptials hc
is his shoslwbin, or the friend of the bricleyroonz.

Ver. 31 t ‘O ὢν ἐκ τῆς γῆς, ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἐστι· ΗΘ that is of the
earth is eartloly] Mark but the antithesis, and you will not
suspect any tautology :

1. ‘O ὣν ἐκ τῆς γῆς, He tlcat is of tlte earth, and ὁ ἐρχόμενος
ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, He‘tlzat comem frma heaven. Where the anti-
thesis is not so much between Christ and John, as bet-wixt
Christ and all mankind.

2. Ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἐστι, He is of the earth, and ἐπάνω πάντων
ἐστι, He is above all. He that is of the earth is only of
earthly degree, or rank: and he that is from heaven is above
all degree.

3. Ἐκ τῆς γῆς λαλεῖ, He speaks of the earth, and ὃ ἑώρακε
καὶ ἤκουσε, τοῦτο μαρτυρεῖ, what lte laath seen ami heard, that lm
test‘ffietlz. He that is of the earth speaketh earthly things,
and what he hath learned upon the earth3 but he that is
from heaven speaketh those things which he learned in hea—
ven, viz„ those things which he hath seen and heard from
God. The Baptist seems to allude to the manner of bearing
witness, and teaching. In matter of fact there was need of
an eyewitness3 in matter of doctrine, they delivered what
they had heard from their Master.
