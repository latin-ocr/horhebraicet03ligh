home upon tkefirst rain.

“ Whichy isz the first rain? It begins on the third of the
month Marehesvan. The middle rain is on the seventh ε the
last on the seventeenth. So R. Meier: but R. J udah saith, On
the seventh‚ seventeenth, and one-and-twentieth.”

The spring coming on, they drove their beasts into wilder-
nesses or champaign groundS, where they fed them the whole
summer, keeping watch over them night and day, that they
might not be impaired either by thieves or ravenous beasts.
They had for this purpose ΒῚἾΒἾΞ, ἷΤῐλὮ their lower to watoh
in, or else ΓΞἾἾΒ certain small cottayes erected for this very

Ver. 14: Δόξα ἐν ὑψίστοις Θεῷ, &a Glory to God in tho
hiqlcest] We may very well understand this angelic hymn,
if ἐὐδοκία ἐν ἀνθρώποις, qood will towards men, be taken for
the subject, and the rest of the words for the predicate. The
qood will of God towards men is ylory to G'od in the kiqhest, and
peace on earth. Καὶ, and, is put between δόξα and εἰρήνη,
