Ver. 53: Αὕτη ὑμῶν ἐστιν ἡ ὥρα καὶ ἡ ἐξουσία τοῦ σκότους·
This is your how, and the power of darkness] The serpent
himself is now come in Judas; and the seed of the serpent
was that rout that came with him, to whom it was fatal to
bruise the hee] os the Messiah3 and now was the hour for
that wickedness. It was anciently foretold and predeter-

chains of the devil himself are now loosed 3 and it is permitted
to him, without the least check or restraint of Divine Provi-
dence‚ to exert all his furies at pleasure3 for now is the power
of darkness. ἡ

death, who darkeneth the eyes of men.”

worship of God with idolatry. This was the accusation they
framed against our Saviour at this time, that he taught hete-
rodox and destructive principles, such especially as would tend
to turn off and alienate the people from their obedience to the
Romans. Aruch recites this passage of the Talmud more

cautiously; for instead of as Jeszcs of Nazareth did, he hath it,
as Jeroboam did.
