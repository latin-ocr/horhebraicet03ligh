words, if you should render Akolibamah the dauylcter of Anah,
the dauylzter of Zibwn, you emasculate Anah, and make a

2. Suppose it could be granted that Joseph might be
called the son of Heli (which yet ought not to be), yet
would not this be any great soleoism, that his son-in-law
should become the husband of Mary, his own daughter. He
was but his son by law, by the marriage of J oseph's mother,
not by nature and generation.

Thereh is a discourse of a certain person who in his sleep

the son of Neri] Ι. That Pedaiah, the father of Zorobabel,
1 Ohron. iii. 19, is omitted here, is agreeable with Ezra v. 2,
Hagg. i. 1, διας but why it should be omitted, either here
or there, is not so easy to guess.

ΙΙ. As to the variation of the names both here and
1 Chron. iii, this is not unworthy our observation: that
Zorobabel and his sons were carried out of Babylon into
Judea3 and, possibly, they might change their names when
they changed the place of their dwelling. It was not very
