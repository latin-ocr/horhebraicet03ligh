the Gentiles! ‚

ΙΙ. That by these instances he plainly intimated the calling
of the Gentiles, than which nothing could be more grating in
the ear of the Jews. Elijah was sent to a heathen woman,
and a heathen man was sent to Elisha: and bot-h of them
were turned from heathenism to the true religion. Those
words therefore of Naaman, 2 Kings v. 17, 18, I would thus
render; “ Thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt
offering nor sacrifice to strange gods, but unto J ehovah. And
concerning this thing the Lord pardon thy servant [viz. oon-
cerning my former idolatry], that when my master went into
the house of Rimmon to worship there, and leaned upon my
hand, I also bowed myself in the house of Rimmon3 for that
I bowed myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy
servant concerning this thing.''

And the priest that ministers in his uncleanness, his brethreu
the priests beat out his brains with clubs.'' But doth this
license of the zealot belong to all persons upon all occasions?
W'hen N athanasl said, [John i. 46.] “Can there any good thing
come out of Nazareth 3” he does not seem there to refiect so
much upon the smalluess and insignificancy of the town, as the
looseness and depravity of its manners [oppidanorum].

Ver. 33⁰: ’Έχωυ πνεῦμα δαιμονίου ἀκαθάρτου· leo had α
