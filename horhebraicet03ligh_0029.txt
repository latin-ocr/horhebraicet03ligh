he tarried so Zony] There is something of this kind told of
Simeon the Just, coneerning whom we have made some
mention already z

“ Theg high priest made a short prayer in the holy placo.
He would not be long in prayer, lest he should occasion any
sear in the people. There is a story of one who tarried a
long while in it, and the people were ready to have entered
in upon him. They say it was Simeon the Just. They say
unto him, ‘Why didst thou tarry so long 3* He answeresl them,
saying‚ ⁶ I have been praying for the Temple of your Gocl, that
it be not destroyed? They answered him again, ⁶ However, it
was not well for you to tarry so long.7 ''

the experiment upon him three timeS,’' &c And a little
after, ΨἾΠ ΠΤὍἾ ἶᾋγ ΓΞῺἸΒ ΓΝ they do not much γεῖς]
upon the εἷρπε of the deas aad dumb man. For as it is in the

Amongst the doctore, the ἮἾΠ the deas and dumb person is
commonly looked upon as one made so by some fit of palsy or
apoplexy, by which the intellectuals are generally affected:
whence the deas and dumb are, according to the traditional
canons, deprived of several offices and privileges of which
others are capable.
