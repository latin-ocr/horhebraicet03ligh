had deserved that name, however the Jews vainly enough
had honoured the memories of some with that title; which
we shall not meddle with at this present. But was this Anna

very reason, probably, it is here remarked that she was of
the tribe of Aser.

this savour something of Christ’s coming out of Galilee?

discharged any office in the Temple: some think they did.
But that which they allege out of 1 Sam. ii. 22, concerning
the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation, is quite another thing from any public
ministering, if we will admit the Targumist and'lzhe Rabbins
for expositors. So Exod. xxxviii. 8, ΠῆΝᾏἿ-ΒΓῙ women as-
sembliny by troops at the door of the tabernacle of the con-
gregation. The Targumists both here and in the place be-
fore quoted have it, „⁸535 ΓΠᾺἻ ΓΦ) women that came to
pray. The Greek interpreters read it mmm for mmmm
for they render it, υηστευσασῶν, αἳ ἐνήστευσαν. And by the
same boldness, οι· blindness, wholly left out that clause, 1 Sam.
ii. 22 3 “and how they lay with the women that assembled at
the door of the tabernacle of the cong1·egation.'’

It is apparent, that women were wont to come from other
parts to the tabernaclo for devotion's sake, not to perform
any ministry. So this Anna, by birth of the tribe (γ’ Aser,
had changed her native soil, and fixed her abode at Jeru-
salem, partly for devotion, that she might be the more at
leisure for praying in the Temple, and partly as a prophetess‚
that she might utter her prophecies in the great metropolis.

II. She departed not from the Temple ,· that is, not in the
stated times of prayer ; according as it is commanded Aaron
