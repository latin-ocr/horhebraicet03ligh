justly questionable.

II. Amongst all the blemishes and defects whereby the
beast was rendered unfit for sacrifice, we do not read that
this was ever reckoned, “that they had not been washed.”
Do we believe that Abraham washed the ram caught in
thicket, Gen. xxii, before he sacrificed it? lt is said, indeed f,
“ 'almvm ἿῙἯΔΠ that lze took it ancl wiped it. But this was
after he had taken off the skin. He took it, 'ityfflffi‘ffi aad

skin of thy servant Isaac was taken off before thee! He
wiped it [Gloss‚ 2520: ἺΠὶρζὶ ke wipecl it with α symma] aud
said, ‘ Behold this, as if Isaac was wipe(l.' He burnt it, and
said‚” &a

And let that be well considered in Siphra, fol. 18. ι, where
a dispute is had upon those words, Lev. vi. 27 ; “ If the blood
of the sacrifice for sin be sprinkled upon a garment, ἕω.

skin as yet cleaving to the beast’s back, and not flayed off, is
not capable of uncleanness.

Ι. Ι would therefore judge rather, that men, and not beasts,
were washed in the pool of Bethesda. I mean the unclean,
that by washing they might be purified. For whoever con-
siders the numbers of the unclean that did every day stand
in need of being washed, and whoever would a little turn
over the Talmudic treatises about purifications, and the
gatherings of waters for those purposes, might easily per-
suade himself that both Bethesda, and all the other pools in
Jerusalem, did serve rather for the washing of men, and not
of beasts. , Δ
