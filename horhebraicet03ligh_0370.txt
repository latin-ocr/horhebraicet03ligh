party is carried out of the court gates R. Joshua saith,
‘ From the time that the cover of the coffin is shut down.'
When Rabban Gamaliel died, and the corpse was carried out
of the court gate, saith R. Eleazar to his disciples, ‘ Take
down the beds.’ But when the coffin was closed, R. Joshua
said, ‘ Take down the beds? On the evening of the sabbath
they set up their beds3 at the going out of the sabbath they
take them down.”

What is to be understood by taking down their beds we
may conjecture by what follows. “ WhenceS came the custom
of taking down the beds? R.Orispa in the name of R. J ochanan
saith, From what is written, ΥἾζῄἶζ) fin& ’131ρᾓ And they sat
with him near tlce yrozmd [J ob ii. 13]. It is not said, upon the

ground, but Y]232³?·72ea7· the ground3 that is, not far off from

the earth. Hence is it that they sat upon beds taken lower
[lectos depressos].'’

where but upon the floor.’'

ΙΙ. The mourner himself sits chief. A custom taken from
these words, J ob xxix, 25, ‘⁶ l chose out their way and sat
chief like him who comforts the mourners.'' Ibid.

ΙΙΙ. It was not lawful for the comforters to speak a word
till the mourner himself break silence first. The pattern taken
from J ob’s friends, J ob ii.

head, the comforters are to sit by him no lower? The Gloss is,
“ If, by nodding his head, he signify to them that he hath
comforted himself.’' Hence that frequently said of some,
ΓΌἾΓΠΠ 'bxv &³7 They would not receive comfort,· that is,
they gave signs by nodding their head that they had suffi-
ciently comforted themselves.

These and many other things about this matter do occur in
Moed Isaton; and Rabbenu Asher‚ and ΨΝἾΠ *pmcn upon
this treatise: as also in Massa-heth semem& where, by the
