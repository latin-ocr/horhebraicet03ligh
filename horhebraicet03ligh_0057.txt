Ch. iii. 8, &eff Erercitcctions upon St. Luke. 51

ii. 6: “ There was a cloud went before them, three days'

Journey, ΝἾἻΨἮ “lrmlvw &inim &2:705 το take down the

wilderness, and all scorpions; and found out for them a fit
place to lodge in.'²

What the meaning of the prophet in this passage was,
Christiane well enough understandt The Jews apply it to
levelling and making the ways plain for Israel's return out of
captivity: for this was the main thing they expected from the
Messiah, viz. to bring back the captivity of Israel.

“ R. Chananq saith, Israel shall have no need os the doc-
trine of Messiah the King in time to come3 for it is said,
To him shall the Gentiles seek (Isa. xi. 10), but not Israel.
If so, why then is Messiah to come? and what is he to do
when he doth come? He shall gather together the captivity
of Israel,'' &c.

Ver. 8: Ἐκ τῶν λίθων τούτων ἐγεῖραι τέκνα τῷ Ἀβραάμ· Of
these stones to recise up children amo Abraham] We do not
say the Baptist played with the sound of those two words
&⁸22 banaia, ancl &³3:24 abanaia : he does certainly, with
great scorn, deride the vain confidence and glorying of that
nation (amongst whom nothing was more ready and usual in
their mouths than to boast that they were the children of
Abraham), when he tells them, That they were such children
of Abraham, that Grod could raise as good as they from those
very stones.

Ve1·,1 1 : ‘O ἔχων δύο χιτῶνας μεταδότω τῷ μὴ ἔχοντι· He that
hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath nona] It would
be no sense to say, He that hath two coam, let him give to
him that hath not two3 but to him that bath none: for it
was esteemed for religion by some to wear but one single coat
01· garment: of which, more elsewhere.
