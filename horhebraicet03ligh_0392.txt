After the days of Messiah, they expected that eternity should
follow.

Ver. 3914: Διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἠδύναντο πιστεύειν, 810. Thercfore
they could not believe, 23⁸6] They were not constrained in their
infidelity, because Isaiah had said, “Their heart is waxen
grosS‚'' &c.; but because those things were true which that
prophet had foretold concerning them: which prophecy, if I
understand them aright, they throw off from themselves, and
pervert the sense of it altogether.

“ R. J ochananl saith, Repentance is a great thing; for it
rescinds the decree of judgment determined against man: as
it is written, ‘ The heart of this people is made fat, their ears
heavy, and their eyes are closed, lest they should see with their
eyeS, and hear with their ears, and understandm with their
heart: 5³7 Νῷᾟ my] bat they shall be converted and Imdedss '’
[Is. vi.10.] For to that sense do they render these last words,
diametrically contrary to the mind of the prophet.

They have a conceit that Isaiah was cut in two, either by
the saw or the axe, by Manasseh the king, principally for this
very vision and prophecy:

“ It¹¹ is a tradition. Simeon Ben Azzai saith, l found a
book at Jerusalem ...... in which was written how Manasses
slew Isaiah. Rabba saith he condemned and put him to
death upon this occasion : he saith to him, Thy master
Moses saith, ‘No man can see God and live:’ but thou
sayest, ‘I have seen the Lord sitting upon a throne, high
and lifted up.7 Thy master Moses saith, ⁴ Who is like our
God in all things that we call upon him fori’ Deut. iv. 7:
but thou sayest, ‘ Seek ye the Lord while he may be found,'
Isa. lv. 6. Moses thy master saith, ‘ The number of thy days
Ι will fulfil,’ Exod. xiii. 26: but thou sayest, ‘ I will add unto
thy days fifteen years,' Isa. xxxviii. 5. Isaiah answered and
said, ‘ Ι know he will not hearken to me in any thing I ean
say to him: ifI should say any thing to the reconciling of
the Scriptures, I kriow he will deal contemptuously in it.'
