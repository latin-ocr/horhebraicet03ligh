82 Heba-ew and Tatmudical [Oh. vi. 38.

I cannot but laugh at their triflings, and yet withal observe
the opinion that nation had, and compare it with this phrase,
προσευχὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ, the prayer of God. They will have it that
Orod prays, not by way of supplicati0n‚ but authority : “ So let
it be.’' Thus our blessed Lordk sometimes, Πάτερ, θέλω, ΡαίῘιθν,
Ι will, John xvii. 24. Whether the phrase in this place should
be thus interpreted‚ Ι do not determine. ’

Ver. 38: Μέτρον καλὸν, πεπιεσμένου, 850. Good measure,
pressed down, &c.] l. Concerning ΠἾΡἸΠῺἾ numm ΠἾἾὩ
measures lzeaped up ancl strichen offi see ιΜεηασοτΙι, fol. 87 ε
w R. Men· saith, It is said, 717er mab pam> mum a tenth,
a tenth to every lamb. W hence is hinted, that there were
two ,ΠἸΞἸἻΠῺ decimaries [or titlez'nfy mcasures] in the Temple:
tvi-m ἻΠΝ one heaped up, ,ὫἹΠΌ ἿΠΗἾ tlte otker strichen effi
Tlce heaped up was that by which they measured all their
bread-eorn for holy uses [ΠἾΠΠῺΠ ἰ73]. That which, was
stricken eff was that whereby they measured the cakes or
the high priest's loaves.'⁷ “ Alll the measures in the Temple
were heaped up, besides that of the high priests.'' Now the
Gloss‚ giving the reason why this was not heaped up as well as
the other, tells us, “ It was because he was to divide the flour
into two tenths ; if therefore the measure was heaped up, some
of the fine flour would spill upon the ground as he moved it
this way and that way in dividing it.'⁷

“Rabhm Papa asked‚ ἸὉΞΠ &lym [plenitudo payillorum]
the filliny of the priest's hand whereof we have mention,
mun-m ἿΝ filimi-m, 'eoas it by tlte measure strichen qff or heaped

up? R. Aba saith to Rabh Ishai, The filling of the priest’s -

hand, of which we have mention, was neither by tlte measure-5
strichen off* nor heaped up, &³2:me 24³7& but by measure-5
floatiny over.’'

II. Every one may observe that our evangelist in his repe-
tition of this sermon upon the mount doth omit many things
that are set down in St. Matthew ; those especially that have
relation to the dictates and glosses of the scribes and Pharisees
about manslaughter, oathS, divorces, &c.; or their customs
in their pmyers, fasts, and alnis, &c. Writing for the service
of the Gentiles, he passeth over what respecteth the J eWS.
