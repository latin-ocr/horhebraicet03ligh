(lh. vi. 45] Emercitations upon St. John. 307

dren shall be taught of God, and great shall be the peace of
thy children.’ Tm: NS& *1³22 ἿἾζὶΠ ΒΝ Do not read [ΠἾᾉ]

But who were there among mortals that were more tauylct
of men and less of God, being learned in nothing but the tra-
ditions of the fathers? He must be tauqlzt of the Father that
would come to the Son3 not of those sorry fathers: he must
be tazcylzt qf God. not those 'masters of traditions.

Ver. 5¹ : ‘O ἄρτος ὃν ἐγώ δώσω, ἡ σάρξ μου ἐστίν· lee broad
that I will 'aive ris my flesh] He tacitly confutes that foolish
conceit of theirs about I know not what dainties the Messiah
should treat them with ; and slights those trifles, by teaching
that all the dainties which Christ had provided were himself.
Let them not look for wonderful messes, rich feasts, &c.;
he will give them himself to eat3 bread beyond all other pro-
visions whatever 3 food from heaven3 and such as bringeth
salvation.

As to this whole passage of eating the flesh and drinking
the blood of Christ, it will be necessary to premise that of
Mark iv. 1 1, 12 : ‘⁴ I speak by parables ς and all these things
are done in parables; that seeing they may see, and not per-
ceive,” &c. Ver. 34: ‘⁴ Without a parable spake he not unto
them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things
to his disciples.''⁹

And what can we suppose in this place but pal-able wholly?

l. There was nothing inore common in the schools of the
Jews than the phrases of ‘ eating and drinking' in a meta-
phorical sense. And surely it would sound very harsh‚ if not
to be understood here metaphorically‚ but literally. What !
to drink blood? a thing so severely interdicted the Jews once
and again. What! to eat man's flesh? a thing abhorrent
to human nature3 but above all abhorrent to the Jews, to
whom it was not lawful to eat ''Ua-1 VD 52& a member of α
