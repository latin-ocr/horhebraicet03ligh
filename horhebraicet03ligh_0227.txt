Ver. 32¹: Οὐχὶὴ καρδία ἡμῶν καιομένη ἣν ἐν ἡμῖυ; Did not
our hearts burn within us .9] Beza saith, “ In one copy we read
it written, κεκαλυμμένη ἦν, PVas not ozor beart hid? Heinsius
saith, “ It is written κεκαλυμμένη, hidden, in the best copies.’'
Why then should it not be so in the best translations too?
But this reading favours his interpretation, which amounts to
this: “VVere we not fools, that we should not know him
while he was discoursing with us in the way3’' I had rather
expound it by some such parallel places as these z ‘⁶ My heart
waxed hot within me, and while I was musing the fire burned,''
Psahn xxxix. 4 ς “ His word was in mine heart as a burning
fire,'' J er. xx. 9. The meaning is, That their hearts were so
affected, and grew so warm, that they could hold no longer,
but must break silence and utter themselves. So these,
‘ Were we not so mightily affected, while he talked with us in
the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures, that we
were just breaking out into the acknowledgment of him, and
ready to have saluted him as our Lord ζ’

That is a far-fetched conceit in Taanithm: “R. Alai Bar
Barachiah saith, If two disciples of the wise men journey
together, and do not maintain some discourse betwixt them-
selves concerning the laW, they deserve to be burnt; accord-
ing as it is said, It came to pass, as they still went on and
talked‚ behold a chariot of fire, and horses of fire‚” Suc.

Σίμωνι· Sayiny, T he Lord is risen indeed, and laath appeared

and them that were with them, sayiny. They having returned
from Emmaus, found the eleven and the rest, saying to them,
when they came into their presence, “ The Lord is risen

these things amongst themselves as certain and believed? or
do they tell them to the two disciples that were come from
