Ch. iv. 25] Emercv'tations upon St. John. 285

on but to the end of the verse, and thou wilt find the Lord of
hosts is his name.’ ”

That passage also is remarkablei: “ They do not snatch
napy-⁴3 *mm ἶηηπῖᾗλη the books ancl volumes of the lceretics
from the flames; but they may be burnt where they are.”
The Gloss is, “The books of heretics‚ i. e. ³⁰2⁷& ΕἾἾἾῙΠὮ
idolaters, [or those that use any stranqe worship} who wrote
out the Law, the ProphetS, and the Holy WVritings, for their
own use in the Assyrian character and holy language.” But
umam ῬΨΞ ἽἾΞΞἾ) upon the place renders it *³205 ΓΓΓᾸἎ
ΓΒἜΌ ΓΝ ΞῬἸἺΒ They snatela not azvay the volumes (md
books of the Saclducees. If by keretics the Sadducees are to be
understood, as the latter Gloss would have it, then com-
paring it with the former, they had the Law, Prophets, and
the Holy Writings writ in the Assyrian character in the holy
language.

If by heretios the Christianus are understood, as in the
former Gloss (for as to the Gentiles, there is no room to
understand it of them in this place), then we see what copies
of the Old Testament the Hebrew Ohristians anciently had
in use.

It may be objected, That if the Sadclzwees admitted the
books of the Prophets and the Holy WVritings with this ex-
ception only, that they had them not read in their synagogues,
how came they to (leny the resurrection from the dead, when
it is so plainly asserted in those books?

To this may be( answered, That this argument might have
something in it, if it had not been one fundamental of the
Sadducees' fait-h, that no article in religion ought to be ad-
mitted that cannot be made out plainly from the five books
of Moses, Compare this with that of the Phariseesk3 “ How-
ever any person may acknowledge the resurrection from the
dead, yet if he does not own that there is some indication of
it in the laW, he denies a fundamental.’' So that whereas
Moses seemed not, clearly and in terminis, to express himself
as to the resurrection, the Sadducees would not admit it as
