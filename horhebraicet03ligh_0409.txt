words seem to have an allusion to that law concerning
Πῖξᾜξ] or tlze uncircumcision of the tree when first planted,
Levi xix. 23. For the first three years the fruit was to be
accounted as uncircumcised‚ unclean‚ and not to be eaten;
“ But you, Ο my branches, now are clean through my word;
that word which Ι have been preaching to you for these
three years.” ‘

Ver.4: Μείνατε ἐν ἐμοί· Abide in ma] Indeed, a true
fixing and abiding in Christ is by a true saith. But may we
not suppose our Saviour here more peculiarly warning them
against apostasy‚ or falling back from the gospel into Ju—
daism‚ a plague likely to rago exceedingly in the church Ξ

Ver. 6³: ςΩς τὸ κλῆμα· As a braitoft] See Ezek. xv. 2,
where D. Kimchi paraphrases in this manner: “O Son of
man, Ι do not ask thee concerning the vine that beareth fruit
(for so it ought to be accounted), but concerning the bromeh

[Uffinssffl] which is amongst the trees of the wood, unfruitful,

even as the trees themselves are.’' Where, by ΠἾῆῃζ which
we render brancla (for so it is commonly rendered), we* are to
understand the wicel vine. So R. Solonion in loc.: “ Ι (10 not
speak (saith God) of the vine in the vineyard that bears fruit,
but of the branclc of the wild vine that grows in the woods.'’
So that the sense of the prophet is, “ O son of man, what is
the vine tree more than any tree?” viz, a branch of the wild
vine which grows amongst the trees of the forest, which is
unfruitful, even as they are.

And this is our Saviour's meaning ς “ Every branck in me
that bringeth not forth fruit is cast forth like the brand» in
the vine that grows wild in the forest, which is good for no-
thing but to be burned.''

And to this sense would Ι take the word ΠᾎἼὩἙ in the same
prophet, chap. viii. 17, 0ξὸλῖζῇ ”Zlffiffffl'flss ῃὲῃῖῗξῃ· ΞΞΠἿ 3
