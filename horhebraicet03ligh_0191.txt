diseases, scarcity of bread, drought.’' “ Ast the¹ congregation
fasts upon the occasion of general calamities, so does this or
that person for his particular afflictions. If any that belong
to him be sich, or lost in the wilderness, or kept in prison, he
is bound tofast in his behalf‚'' &c.

ΙΙ. “ T heu fests appointed by the congregation by reason
of general calamities, are not from day to day, because there
are few that could hold out in such a fast, but 'mum-12⁸1 Um:
οη the second amlfiftlc days of the week.” On those days they
assembled in their synagogues to public prayers: and to this
I would refer that of Acts xiii. 2, λειτουργούντων αὐτῶν καὶ νη-
στευόντων, as they ministered before the Lord anclfasted ; much
rather than to the celebration of the mass, which some would
be wresting it to.

ΠΙ. It was very usual for ἻἺἻἾ the sinyle person, to devote
himself to stated and repeated fasts for religion's sake, even
when there was no affliction or calamity of life to urge them
to it.. And those that did so chose to themselves those very
days which the congregation was wont to do; viz. the sacoma

and the fiftlz days of the weekX. ’Ἕω vin? ³7:³57& ἾἾΠἼ

Let me add this one thing further about these fests .· “ R.
Chasda saith, The fast upon which the sun sets is not to be
called a fast.” And yet they take very good care that they
be not starved by fastiwq, for they are allowed to eat and drink
the whole night before the fast. “ It)r is a tradition. Rabbi
saith, It is lawful to eat till day-light.''
