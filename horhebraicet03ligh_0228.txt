Emmaus, as things true and unquestionable? It is plain from
St. Mark, that the eleven did not believe the resurrection of
our Saviour, till he himself had shewed himself in the midst
of them ¹1. They could not, therefore, say these words, ‘⁶ The
Lord is risen, and hath appeared unto Simon‚” as if they were
confidently assured of the truth of them: but when they saw
Simon so suddenly and unexpectedly returning, whom they
knew to have taken a journey towards Galilee, to try if he
could there meet with Jesus, they conclude hence, “Oh!
surely the Lord is risen, and hath appeared to Simon‚'' other-
wise he would not have returned back so soon.

Which brings to mind that of the messenger of the death
of Maximino : “ The messenger that was sent from Aquileia
to Rome, changing his horses often. came with so great speed‚
that he got to Rome in four days. It chanced to be a day
wherein some games were celebrating‚ when on a sudden, as
Balbinus and Gordianus were sitting in the theatre, the mes-
senger camo in3 and before it could be told, all the people
cry out, ‘ Maximin is slain;’ and so prevented him in the
news he brought‚'' &a

We cannot well think that any worldly affairs could have
called away these two from the feast before the appointed
time, nor indeed from the company of their fellow-disciples,
but something greater and more urgent than any worldly
occasions. And now imagine with what anguish and per-
plexity poor Peter's thoughts were harassed for having
denied his Master: what emotions of mind he felt, when the
women had told him, that they were commanded by angels
to let Peter particularly know that the Lord was risen, and
went before them into Galilee‚ and they might see him there,
Mark xvi. 7: that it seems to me beyond all question, that
one of these disciples going towards Emmaus was Peter, who
as soon as he had heard this from the women, taking Alpheus
as a companion of his joumey, makes towards Galilee, not
without communicating beforehand to his fellow-disciples the
design of that progress: they, therefore, finding him so sud·
denly and unexpectedly returned, make the conjecture ’
amongst themselves, that certainly the Lord had appeared
to him, else he would never have come back so soon. Compare
