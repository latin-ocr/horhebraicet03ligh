either deceived himself, or would deceive others. Timnah
was not a man, but a woman3 not the son of Eliphaz, but
his concubine3 not Amalek's brother, but his mother, Gen.
xxxvi. 12. Only the Holy Ghost teacheth us by this short-
ness of speechS, to recur to the original story from whence
these things are taken, and there consult the determinate
explication of the whole matter ε which is frequently done by
the same Holy spirit, speaking very briefiy in stories well
known before.

The Gentiles have no reason to cavil with the evangelist in
this matter 3 for he agrees well enough with their Bibles. And
if the Jews, or we ourselves, should find fault, he mayt defend
himself [respondere habet ille] from the common usage of the
Holy Ghost, in whom it is no rare and unusual thing, in the
recital of stories and passages well enough known before, to
vary from the original, and yet without any design of deceiv-
ing, 01· suspicion of being himself deceived ; but, according to
that majesty and authority that belongs to him, dictating and
referring the reader to the primitive story, from whence he
may settle and determine the state of the matter, and inquire
into the reasons of the variation. St. Stephen imitates this
very custom, while he is speaking about the burial of the
patriarchs‚ Acts vii. 15, 163 being well enough understood by
his J ewish auditory, though giving but short hints in a story
so well known. ,

Ιῌ. It is one thing to dictate from himself, and another
thing to quote what is dictated from others, as our evangelist
in this place doth. And since he did, without all question,
write in behalf of the Gentiles, being the companion of him
who was the great apostle of the Gentiles, what should hinder
his alleging according to what had been dictat-ed in their
Bibles ?

When the apostle names the magicians of Egypt, J annes
and Jambres, 2 Tim. iii. 9, he doth not deliver it for a certain
thing, or upon his credit assure them that these were their
very names, but allegeth only what had been delivered by
others, what had been the common tradition amongst them,
