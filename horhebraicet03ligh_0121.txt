Oh. xi. 15.] Exercitatz'mzs upon St. Luke. 115

Let it be granted that Beelzebub might change his soil upon
some occasion, and remove from Ekron to Cyrene: but then
how should he come to be the pm'uce of elce devils, when all
his business and power was only among fl'z’es ‚9

It may not be improbable, perhapS, that he might be first
or chief of those demons, or Baalim, that Ahab brought
among the Israelites; and so Ahaziah his son, in the midst
of his affliction and danger, might fly for refuge to that idol
as what had been the god of his father: but what is it could
move the ages following at so long distance of time from
this, that they should esteem this demon Beelzebub the prz'uce
qf tiae devils ,9 Here I confess myself not well satisfied : but
as to Beelzebul, something may be said.

IV. I have already shewn, in notes upon Matt. xii, that
the Jewish doctors (and such were these who contended
with our Saviour) did give idolatrous worship the deno-
mination of 3753} zebul, 01· cluuq, for the ignominy of the
thing; and so was the nation generally taught by these
Rabbins. I gave some instances for the proof of it, which
I shall not here repeat, but add one more: “ It m is said of
Joseph'’ [when his mistress would have tempted him to
adultery], “ that he came into the house to do his business.
R. J udah saith, ΠἾΠ ἶῖἾΞἾῖἾ ἶῖἾΞὉ tm* It was a (lay offoolc‘ny
ancl of d¹uu9in9‚ it was a day of theatres.” Where the Gloss
upon the word ‘75:⁵3 zebul, stercoration, saith thus: “ It is
a word of contempt, and so it is expounded by R. Solomon
in the treatise Avodak Zarab, and Tosapbotlz ,· viz. that ³752*
signifies to sacrffiee [that is, to idols]; and they prove it out
of Jerusalem Barac-om, where it is said, ⁵ He that seeth a place
‘1395 ³:127 ΓΒΞΠΖ) ''¹wa where they cluuy [that is, offer sacrifice]
to au idol, let him say, W hoso offereth sacrifice to strange
gods, let him be accursed.'” Which words we have also
alleged out of the Jerusalem Talmucl.

V. Now therefore, when idolatry was denominated zebul
amongst the Jews, and indeed reckoned amongst the most
grievous of sins they could be guilty of, that devil whom they
supposed to preside over this piece of wickedness they named
him Beelzebub, and esteemed him the prime of the devils ,· or
