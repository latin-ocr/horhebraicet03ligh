‘rebellans son mentioned Dent. xxi. 18? By no means, if we
take the judgment of the Sanhedrim itself. For, according
to the character that is given of a stubborn and rebellious
son in Sankedrz'm, cap. 8, where there is a set discourse upon
that subject, there can hardly be such a one found in nature
as he is there described. Unless he steal from his father and
his mother, 116 18 not such a son3 unless he eat awa ἾὩἺΔἾΠ
half a pound of flesh, and drink half a log of wine, he is not
such a son. If 1118 father 01· mother be lame or blind, he is
not such a son, Sec. Half a pound of flesh! It is told of
Maximin, that “ he drank frequently in one day a Capitoline
bottle [amphoram] of wine, and ate forty pounds of flesh ; or,
as Cordus saith, threesc01·e¹.''

Ver. 1 : ὁΟς εἶχεν οἰκονόμου· ΠἿιὶι-Ιι had α steward] This
parable seems to have relation to the custom of letting out
grounds, which we find discoursed of, Domai, cap. 6, where it·
is supposed a ground is let by its owner to some tenant upon
this condition, that he pay half, or one third or fourth part
of the products os the ground, according as is agreed betwixt
them as to the proportion and quantity. So, also, he sup-
poses an olive-yard let out upon such kind of conditions.
And there it is disputed about the paymentm of the tithes,
in what manner it should be compounded between the owner
and him that occupies the ground.

Οἷκουόμος with Kimchi is ἻᾮΞ pakidlc ¹¹, where he hath a
parable not much unlike this: “ The world (saith he) 18 like
unto a house built ; 1116 heaven is the covering of the house 3
the stars are the candles in the house3 the fruits of the earth
are like a table spread in the house ; the owner os the house,
and he indeed that built it, is the holy blessed God. Man in
the world is ἺῬΞ) vnn, as it were the οἰκονόμος, steward of the
house, into whose hands his lord hath delivered all his riches‚
if he behave himself well, he will find favour 111 the eyes of
his lorch if ill, ἻΓΠᾫΕ) {D *may* loe will remove lm'm from
his stewardsksz.”
