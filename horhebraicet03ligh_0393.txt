He said therefore, ΝῚἾΝΞ ὩίἳΞἾΝ ‘I will slent myseff up in
this cedar? They brought the cedar, and sawed it asunder.

cause he said, ‘ Ι dwell in the midst of a people of unclean

Manasseh slew Isaiah, and, as it should seem, the Gemarists
do not dislike [improbant] the fact, because he had accused
Israel for the uncleanness of their lips. ,No touching upon
Israel by any meansf

Ver. 41 : ‘'O-re εἶδε τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ· When lae saw his ρῖονφ]
Isa. vi. 1 ε “ Ι saw the Lord sitting upon a throne.'' Where
the Targum, ''w-1 &557³ n* ἾΠἺΠ I saw the Lord's ylorffi &c
So Exod. xxiv. 10: “ They saw the God of Israel.'' Targum,
ἾΡἿ 'stu-'U “ They saw the ylory of the Grod of Israel.” And
ver. 11 ς “ And they saw God.” Targum‚ &537³ ἾῖΠἾ “ Ami
they saw tlte §lory of God.”' So the Targumists elsewhere very
often : commended therefore by their followers for so render-
ing it, Because no man could see God.

It might be therefore thought that our evangelist speaks
with the Targumist and the nation when he saith, that
“ Isaiah saw his glory;” whereas the prophet himself saith,
“ He saw the Lord.’'

But there is a deeper meaning in it: nor do I doubt but
this qlory of our Saviour which Isaiah saw was that kind of
ylory by which he is described when he was to come to avenge
himself and punish the J ewish nation. As when he is said,
“to come in his kingdon1‚” and “ in his glory,” and “ in the
clouds‚” &a viz. in his vindictive glory. For obser-ve,

1. The prophet saw “ the posts of the door shaken and
removed,'’ as hastening to ruin. 2. “ The Temple itself filled
with smokez'' not with the cloud as formerly, the token of
the divine presence, but with smoke, the forerunner and
prognostic of that fire that should burn and consume it.
3. He saw the seraphim, angcls of fire, because of the pre-
determined burning. 4. He heard the decree about blinding
and hardening the people till the citios bc wastod, and the
land desolate.
