tions and the false glosses ye have put upon them. And
when with John Baptist, the kingdom of heaven arose and
made its entry among you, πᾶς εἰς αὐτὴν βιάζεται, every one
usetlz violence and hostility ayaz'nst it, by contradiction, perse-
cution, and laughing it to scorn. And yet, though you by
your foolish traditions have made even the whole law void
and of none effect, it is easier certainly for heaven and earth
to pass away, than that one tittle of the law should fail.
Take but an instance in the first and most ancient precept
of the law, ‘ The man shall cleave unto his wife ς’ which you,
by your traditions and arbitrary divorces, have reduced to
nothing3 but that still remains, and will reniain for ever, in
its full force and virtue; and he that puts away his wife (ac-
cording to the licentiousness of your divorces) and marrieth
another, committeth adulte1·y.”

Ver. 19¹3: ’Ἄνθρωπος δέ τις ἦν πλούσιος· There was α certain
rich mam] W'hocver believes this not to be a parable, but a
true story, let him believe also those little friars [fratricellis],
whose trade it is to shew the monuments at Jerusalem to
pilgrims‚ and point exactly to the place where the house of
the ‘ rich glutton' stood. Most accurate keepers os antiquity
indeed! who, after so many hundreds of years, such over-
throws of Jerusalem, such devastations and changes, can rake
out of the rubbish the place of so private a house, and such a
one too as never had any being, but merely in pat-able. And
that it was a parable, not only the consent of all expositors
may assure us, but the thing itself speaks it.

The main scope and design of it seems this, to hint the
destruction of the unbelieving Jews, who, though they had
Moses and the Prophets, did not believe them, nay, would
not believe, though one (even J esus) arose from the dead.
For that conclusion of the parableh abundantly evidenceth
what it aimed at: ⁶· [f they hear not Moses and the Pro-
phets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from
the dead.''
