If he did not wash J udas with the rest, but left him out,
how could the rest be ignorant who was the unclean person?
ver. 10, which they were altogether ignorant of.

Ver. 5: Εἰς τὸν νιπτῆρα· Into a basom] “On'' that day,
[when they made R. Eleazar Ben Azariah president of the
council] the votes were numbered ; and they determined
ΠἾῙἋἾΠ ,ΠΞἿἻΏ 3737 concernivy the brison wherein they were to
wash tkeirfeet, that it should contain from two loys to ten.''

’Ἠρξατο νίπτειν τοὺς πόδας, &c. He beyan to wask thesea, ⁶3⁶⁶]
As to this action of our Saviour's waslziny his disciples' feet, it
may be observed, ,

I. It was an unusual thing for superiore to wash the feet of
inferiors. Amongst the duties required from a wife towards
a husband this was one, that she should wast his face, his
hands, and his seetS. The same was expected by a father
from his sont. The same from a servant towards his master,
but not vice versa. Nor, as Ι rememberu, was it expected
from the disciple towards his master, unless included in that
rule, “ That. the disciple is to honour his master more than
his father.”

ΙΙ. The feet were never washed merely under the notion of
legal purification. The hands were wont to be washed by the

Pharisees merely under that not-ion, but not the feet .· and the ’

hands and the feet by the priests, but the feet not merely upon
that account. That what was said before, ΟἾίΞλἾΠ ΠΞἾἾῺ
conoerniny the basin wherein the feet were to be washed, must
not be understood as if the feet were to be waslced upon any
score of a legal cleansing3 but only care was taken by that
tradition, lest through defect of a just quantity of water the
feet and the person should contract some sort of uncleanness
whilst they were washing.

So that by how much distant this action of Christ's was
from the common usage and custom, by so much the more
instructive was it 10 1118 followers‚ propounded to them not
only for example, but doctrine too.
