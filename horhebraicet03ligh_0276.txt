‘''ffl ’Ἴ ΝῺΞ Ε. N. inquired of R. N. Whence that also, as
familiarly used, ND‘& rw: Ἣ, Isyou ask I will tell you. If
the word in this place be taken according to this scholast-ic
use of it, as it may very well be, then we may expound this
passage thus:

The disciples of John, having heard that J esus did baptizo
also, they with the Jews inquire, what· sort of purifying re-
sulted from the baptism of Christ3 whether that purified
more than the baptism of John. The word μετὰ probably
doth not oppose one party against the other, but joins them
together in one inquiry. They inquire jointly, Doth Jesus
superinduce a baptism upon the baptism of John ἓ and John
his upon the baptisms or washing of the J ews? Whither will
this purifying at last tend Ξ and what virtue hath this of J esus's
beyond that of John's?

ΙΙ. Or, if you will, suppose we that this ζήτησις might be a
dispute bctwixt the disciples of St. John and the Jews about
the legal purifications and thc baptism now introduced: there
is no doubt but both parties contended to the uttermost of
their power.

Ver. 27: Οὐ δύναται ἄνθρωπος λαμβάνειν οὐδέν· A man com
receive notlziwy] The rendering of this word λαμβάνειν, re-

ceive, may be a little questioned. The Syriae hath it 20³0ss

to receive. Perhaps it might bc more fitly translated &37:257‘7
to perceive or apprehend. For the Baptist seems in these
words to rebuke the incredulity and stupidity of these men ε
q. d. “ Ye see, by this very instance of yourselves, that no
man can learn, perceive, or believe, unless it be given him
from heaven. For ye yourselves are my witnesses, that I
did prefer J esus before myself, that l testified of him that he
was the Son of God, the Lamb of God, ὤας and ye now
would cavil against him, and prefer me before him, οὐ δύνα-
ται ἄνθρωπος, 810. It is apparent that no one can perceive
or discern'what he ought to do, unless it be given from
heaven.'' Compare with this, ver. 32, “ No man receiveth his

testimon ’.''
