day. Ἰησοῦς δὲ ἐκρύβη, Jesus hid himself; or perhaps the
sense is, he was hiddem that is, by the multitude that had a
favour for him, and compassed him about, lest his enemies
should have wreaked their malice and displeasure against
him.

Ver.7: ὑΟ ἑρμηνεύεται, Ἀπεσταλμένος· Which is ὀρ] inter-
pretation, Sem] We have already shewn that the spring of
Siloam discharged itself by a double stream into a twofold
pool; the Upper pool, which was called ΠἾῖὫἺζ) the pool qs
Siloam,- and the Lower‚ which was called Πῐ-ᾋζθζῖ Πέᾏᾏ the

pool of &zelam- Neh. iii. 15. Now FULJWJ, plainly and pro-
perly signifies Ἀπεσταλμένος-ς but ΠζἻΖ] not so. as we have
already noted. Probably the evangelist added this paren-
thesis on purpose to distinguish which of the pools the blind
man was sent to wash in3 viz. not in the pool Shelalz, which

signifies κωδίων, fleeceS, but in the pool of Shiloczh, which sig· ’

nifies Ἀπεσταλμένος, Sent.

the letter, Deserve something] by πω,- i. e. Acquire something
of merit to yourself by the alms you give me.

Ver. 13: ’Ἄγουσιν αὐτὸν πρὸς Φαρισαίους· leey brouyht him
to the Phari-sees] The Phar-isoes, in this evangelist, are ge-
nerally to be understood the Sankedrim: nor indeed do we
find in St..John any mention of the Sadducees at all. Consult
John i. 243 iv. 1; viii. 33 xi. 46, &c

ΤοιαύτηνΥ δὲ έχουσι [Φαρισαῖοι] τὴν ἰσχὺν παρὰ τῷ πλήθει,
