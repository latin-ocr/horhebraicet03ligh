that is, when the gospel, being published amongst the heathen
nationS, had laid open all the devices and delusions of Satan,
and had restored them from the death of sin and ignorance
to a true state of life indeed. This was ⁶ the first resur-
rection.'

That our Saviour in this place speaks of this resurrection,
I so much the less doubt, because that resurrection he here
intends, he plainly distinguishes it from the last and general
resurrection of the dead, ver. 28, 293 this first resurrection
from that last: which he points therefore to, as it were, with
his finger, by saying, ‘⁶ The hour is coming, and now z‘S,’' &c.

the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and
coming in the clouds ;” they all said, “ Art thou Christ, the
Son of the blessed God ?” by which they imply, that the ‘ Son
of God’ and ⁶ Christ’ are convertible terms : as also are
‘ Christ' and tlte Son of mem. And it plainly shews that
their eyes were intent upon this place: “ Art thou that Son
ofmoen spoken of in Daniel, who is the Son of G0d‚ the Mes-
siah 3” So did Christ in these words look that way.

Ver. 30: Καθὼς ἀκούω, κρίνω· As I hear, I jmlya] He
