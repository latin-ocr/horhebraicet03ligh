nature of the thing judge. For if Machir, Gilead, Shuthelah,
Tahan, and Eran, were with Joseph when Jacob with his
family went down into Egypt, (and if they were not, why are
they numbered amongst those that went down3) then must
Manasseh at the age of nine years, or ten at most, be a grand-
father; and Ephraim at eight or nine. Can I believe that
Moses would relate such things as these? I rather wonder
with what kind of forehead the interpreters could impose
such incredible stories upon the Gentiles, as if it were pos-
sible they should be believed.

IV. It is plain enough to any one that diligently considers
the Greek version throughout, that it was composed by dif-
ferent hands, who greatly varied from one another, both in
style and wit. So that this book was more learnedly ren-
dered than that, the Greek reading more elegant in this book
than in that, and the version in this book comes nearer the
Hebrew than in tham and yet in the whole there is some-
thing of the Jewish craft, favouring and patronising the
affairs of that nation. There is something of this nature in
the matters now in hand, the addition of Oainan, and the five
souls to the seventy that went down into Egypt.

How mightily the Jewish nation valued themselves beyond
all the rest of mankind, esteenling those seventy souls that
went down with Jacob into Egypt beyond the seventy
nations of the world3 he that is so great a stranger in the
J ewish affairs and writings, that he is yet to leam, let him take
these few instances; for it would be needless to add more :

‘⁶ Seventyq souls went down with Jacob into Egypt, that
they might restore the seventy families dispersed by the con-
fusion of tongues, For those seventy souls were equal to
all the families of the whole world. And he that would be
ruling over them, is as if he would usurp a tyranny over the
whole world.''

“ Howr good is thy love towards me, O thou congregation
of Israel! ΝἯῺἸΝ ΓΨΞἮῺ it is more them that of the severely
nations.''

‘⁶ TheS holy blessed God created seventy nations; but he
found no pleasure in any of them, save Israel only.⁵'
