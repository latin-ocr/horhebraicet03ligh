and thirteen precepts of the law may all be reduced to this,
“The just shall live by faith 3²³ and to that of Amos v. 6,
“ Seek the Lord, and ye shall live.''

II. Let these words, then, of our Saviour be set in oppo-
sition to this right and usage in the feast of Tabernacles of

J which we have been speaking: “Have you such wondelful
ε rejoicing at drawing a little water from Siloam? He that

ἐ believes 1n me, whole livels of living waters shall flow out of

his own belly. Do you think the waters mentioned in the

prophets do signify the law? 'They do indeed denote the QX
Spirit, which the Messiah will dispense to those that believe
in him: and do you expect the Holy Spiiit from the laW‚ or
from your rejoicing in the law? The Holy Spirit 1s of faith,
and not of the laW, Gal.' 111. 2.

Ver. 39 : Οὔπω γὰρ ἣν Πνεῦμαᾞλγιον· F or tlze H Oly Gkost was

opinion of the Jews about the departure of the Holy Spirit
after the death of Zechariah and Malachi. To this also must
that passage be interpreted, when those of Ephesus say,
Acts xix. zq, “ W e have not so much as heard whether there
be any Holy Gl1ost:” that is, We have indeed heard of the
Holy Ghost’ s departure after the death of our last prophets,
but of his return and redonation of him we have not yet heard.

l) Low-03, revive thy work in ίΙιὲ midst ‘of the years, in the midst of
thav years make known, Hab. iii. 2. He calls the seventy years of
captivity the meclst of tlte years .· for, on the one hand, it had
been seven times severity years from the birth of Samuel, the
first of the pmphets, to the captivity [Acts ii. 24], and, on
the other hand, it was seven times seventy years from the end
of the captivity to the death of Christ. The prayer is, that
the gift of prophecy might not be lost, but preserved, whiles
the people should live exiled in a heathen country. And ac-
cording to the twofold virtue of prophecy, the one of working
miracles, the other of foretelling things to come, he uses a
twofold phrase, revive thy work, and make known. Nor indeed
was that gift lost in the captivity, but was very illustrious in
Daniel, EzekieL &a It returned with those that came back v
from the captivity, and was continued for one generation3
