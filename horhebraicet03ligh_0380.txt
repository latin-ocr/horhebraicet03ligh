374 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xii. 3.

take notice that Christ suffered the next day after the eating
of the Passover‚ which is our Friday ς it will appear that this
supper was on the evening of the sabbath, that is, the sabbath
now going out.

Let us measure the time in this scheme:

Nisam 9. The sabbath—&x days before the Passover J esus
sups with Lazarus at the going out of the sabbath, when, ac-
cording to the custom of that country, their suppers were
more liberal [lautioresh.

ιο. Sunday.—Five days before the Passover J esus goes to
Jerusalem, sitting on an ass; and on the evening returns to
Bethany, Mark xi. 11. On this day the lamb was taken and
kept till the Passover‚ Exodus xii 3 on which day this Lamb of
Orod presented himself, which was the antitype of that rite.

11. Mondayq.-F0u1· days before the Passover 116 goes to
Jerusalem again; curseth the unfruitful fig trec, Matt. xxi.
18 ; Mark xi. 12 : in the evening he returns again to Bethany,
Mark xi. 19.

12. Tuesday.—Three days before the Passover he goes
again to Jerusalem. His disciples observe how the fig tree
was withered, Mark xi. 20. In the evening, going back to
Bethany, and sitting on the mount of Olives, he foretelleth the
destruction of the Temple and city, Matt. xxiv, and discourses
those things which are contained in Matt. xxv.

. This night he sups with ‘ Simon the leper,' Matt. xxvi. 1,
&c.; John xiii.

¹3· Wednesclaff—This day he passeth away in Bethany.
At the coming in of this night> the whole nation apply them-
selves to put away all leavenr.

14. Thursday.—He sends two of his disciples to get ready
the Passover‚ He himself enters Jerusalem in the afternoon 3
in the evening eats the Passover‚ institutes the eucharist; is
taken, and almost all the night had before [sistitur] the courts
of judicature.

15. Friday.—Afternoon, he is crucified.

16. Saturday.—He keeps the sabbath in the grave.

17. The Lord’s day.—He riseth again.
