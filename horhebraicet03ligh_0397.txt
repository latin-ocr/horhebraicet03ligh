Ch. xiii. 13, 23] Eoeercitations upon St. John. 39]

ΙΙΙ. As to the manner of the action. It is likely he waslaed
their-fiet in the same manner as his own were, Luke vii. 38 ;
viz. while they were leaning at the table (as the Jewish
custom of eating was) he waslaed their feet, as they were
stretched out behind them. And if he did observe any order,
he began with Peter, who sat in the next place immediately
to himself. This Nonnus seems to believe when he renders
it ἀρχόμενος Σίμωνος, Sco. 3 to which opinion also there are
others that seem inclined ; and then the words ἤρξατο
νίπτειν, lm heyam to wash, must be taken in some such sense
as if he made ready and put himself into a posture to wash.
· But perhaps this way of expression may intimate, as if he
began to wash some of his disciples, but did not wash them
all3 which for my own part I could easily enough close with.
F or whereas Christ did this for example and instruction
merely, and not with any design of cleansing them, his end
was answered in waskiny two or three of them, as well as all.
And so indeed I would avoid being entangled in the dilemma
I lately mentioned, by saying‚ he did not only leave J udas
unwashed‚ but several others also. What if he waslwd Peter
and James and John only? And as he had before made some
distinction betwixt these three and the rest of his disciples
by admitting them into his more inward privacies‚ so perhaps
he distinguisheth them no less in this action. These he fore-
told how they were to suffer martyrdom: might he not,
therefore, by this waskz'ny, prefigure to them that they must
be baptized with the same baptismX that he himself was to
be baptized with? and as the woman had anointed him for
his burial, so he, by this action, might have washed them for
that purpose.

ἿΞἾ Εαόὂί, and Ἶῖ) Mar, are titles amongst the doctors very
frequently used, both those of Jerusalem and those of
Babylon.

Ver. 23: Ἀνακείμενος ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ· Leaniny on
Jesus’ bosom] “ Theyy were went to eat leaniny on the left
side, with their feet to the ground, every one singly, upon
their distinct beds.”
