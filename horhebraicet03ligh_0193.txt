II. lt is a question whether any person for his private
praying might come as far as the gate of Nicanor, or the
Gourt of Israel; much less into the Court of the Priests,
unless the priests only. We read of our Saviour's being in
the Gourt of the Gentiles, viz„ in Solomon's Porch, and that
he was in the treasury, or the Court of the Wonlen ς but you
will hardly find him at any time in the Court of Israel. And
the negative upon their entrance into that court is confirmed,
at least if that rule avail any thing which we meet with in
Hieros Beracothf: “ R. Joshua Ben Levi saith, ⁶ He that
stands to pray, it is necessary that he first sit down, because
it is said [Ps. lxxxiv. 5.]‚ ΣΙΠᾛ, ”qv-,7⁰5³ ‘³²32‘ss Blessed arc
they that ⁶ sit' in thy house? '³ Now it was lawful for no person
to sit down in that court but the king only.

III. That therefore this publican stood so much further
off while he prayed than the Pharisee, was probably more
from his humility than any necessity ‘that lay upon him so
to do. For though the heathen and publican go together
in those words of our Saviour, “ Let him be unto thee as a
heathen man and a publican,” yet it is a question whether the
publicans, if they were Jews, were bounded to the outward
court only, as the heathens were.

Οὐκ ἤθελεν οὐδὲ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἐπᾶραι· Heg
would not list 80 much as lais eyes ‘emto heaven] What needed
this to have been added, when this was the very rule of pray-
ing, “ Leth him that prayeth cover his head and look down-
ward.” “ Thei disciple of the wise men, when he stands
praying‚ let him look downward.'' But were those of the
laity or of the common people to do thus? If not, our ques-
tion is answered, that this man (otherwise than the vulgar
was wont) in deep humility and a conscience of his own vile-
ness, would not lift up his eyes. But if this was the usage of
all in common, that whilst they were actually praying they ⁶
must look downward3 yet probably in the time that they
were composing themselves to prayer, they might be a little
lifting up their eyes towards heaven. “ If k they pray in the
Temple, they turn their faces towards the holy of holies 3
