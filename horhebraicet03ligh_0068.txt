62 Hebrew and Talmfmlieal [Oh. iii. 36,

finished, it is fit that all things should continue as they are,
and no alteration should be made! When all had by acela-
mations given their approbation to these things, Demetrius
commanded διαράσασθαι καθὼς ἔθος αὐτοῖς ἐστιυ, 830„ that,
according to their custom, they should imprecate curses upon
Α any that should, by addition, or alteration, or diminution,
ever make any change in it. This they did well in, that all
things might be kept entire and inviolate for ever.’'

If this passage be true, it might be no light matter to the
J ew, when quoting any thing in Greek out of the Old Testa-
ment‚ to depart in the least from the Greek version; and
indeed it is something a wonder, that after this they should
ever dare to undertake any other. But supposing there were

cording to the common conceptions of foolish men, nothing
more true, So neither was this true in itself that is asserted
here3 but only so in the opinion of those for whose sake the
evangelist writes. Nor yet is it the design of the Holy Ghost
to indulge them in any thing that was not true3 but only
would not lay a stumblingblock at present before them ε “ Ι
am made all things to all men, that I might gain some.''

II. There is some parallel with this of St. Luke and that
in the Old Testament, 1 Chron. i. 36: “ The sons of Eliphaz,
Teman, and Omar, and Zephi, and Gatam, and Timnah, and
Amalek.'' Where it is equally false, that Timnah was the
son of Eliphaz, as it is that Oainan was the son of Arphaxad.
But far, far be it from ine to say, that the Holy Ghost was
