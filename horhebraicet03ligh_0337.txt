Ver. 13 p: Περὶ σεαυτοῦ μαρτυρεῖς· Thou bearest record qf thy-
seffi]' This and the following passages uttered in dispute,
whether Christ was the light or no, bring to mind what was
wont to be transacted amongst them in their witnessing
about the φάσις, tlte appearance of the new moon. W'e have
it in Rosk Haslzanahq.

I. It was to be attested before the Sanhedrim by two per-
sons that they saw the new moon. So Christ mentions two
witnesses attesting him to be the light, viz, the F ather and
himself, ver. 18.

ΙΙ. They did not allow the testimony about the new moon,
unless from persons known to the Sanhedrim: or if they were
unknown, there were those sent along with them from the
magistracy of that city where they lived, that should attest
their veracity. Compare ver. 18, 19: “I bear witness of
myself, and ye know me not. My Father also bears witness
of 1ne; but ye have not known my Father.'’

ΙΙΙ. mm> *1⁵¹ 537 mm ἻἿΠἾΠ ΓΝ One witness is not to
be believed in his own cause. So the Pharisees, ver. 13, ‘⁴ Thou
bearest record of thyself 3 thy record is not true.''

IV. The father and the son, or any sort of relatives, are
fit and credible witnesses: ver. 183 “ I am one that bear
witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth wit-
ness of me.''
