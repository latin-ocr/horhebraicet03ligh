This case therefore of Zacharias might have occasioned a
considerable question, whether he ought* not to have been
sequestered from his ministry, and deprived of all the pri-
vileges of his priesthood‚ because he had been struck deas
and dumb, but that it happened to him in so signal and
extraordinary a way.

Ver. 24. Περιέκρυβεν ἑαυτὴν μῆιας πέιτε· She laid lber-§eff
five months] “She hid laelsegf five montlas,sa.yi1]g Thus hath
the L01d dealt with me, in the days wheiein he looked on me,
to take away my reproach among men.

She was big with child, it is plain, because Grod had looked
on her, and taken away her reproach among men. She hid
herself, because the Lord had dealt so with her, till he had
taken away her reproaoh; giving her so remarkable a son,
one who was to be so sti-iot a Namrite, and so famous a
prophet. Lest therefore she should any way defile herself
by going up and down, and thereby contr-act any unc-lean-
ness upon the Nazarite in her womb, she withdraws, and
sequesters herself from all common conversation. Gonsult
Judges xiii. 4.

There were several amongst the Jews that were wont to
take upon them the sect of the Nazarites by their own volun-
tary vow. [Three hundred at once in the days of Jannaeus
the king came together to Simeon Ben Shetahk] But there
were but two only set apart by divine appointment, Samson
and the Baptist : whom the same divine appointment, design-
ing to preserve untouched from all kind of pollution even in
their mothers' wombs, directed that the mothers themselves
should keep themselves as distant as might be from all
manner of defilement whatsoever. Elizabeth obeys3 and for
the whole time wherein she bore the child within her, she hid
herseff, for her more effectually avoiding all kind of unclean-
nesses; although it is true we have the mention but of five
months, by reason of the story of the sim mouth, which was to
be immediately related, ver. 26.
