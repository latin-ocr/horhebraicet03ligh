tained amongst them, that as the eldest was called aaz:
the firstborn so the younger was called 10me simple, because
without the title of firstborn. It seems to be only two
brethren here betwixt whom the complaint is made, but
which of them is the complainant it is not so easy to deter-
mine. You will say the younger most probably, because it
is more likely that the firstborn should wrong the younger,
than the younger the firstborn. And yet in that court of
judicature which they called t nu& ’1δὲ nin-f ΝΞὛἻ “ the court
of Thou εἶναψ (md ΓΜ dravo [Judicz‘zcm de Trahe tu, aut 690

as well as the firstborn to the younger. That matter was
thus ε

or I will redeem mine. Now here the younger brother may
be perverse, and as well hinder the redemption as the first-
born.

and quarrels may arise, both reason and common experience
do abundantly teach us. The Rabbins are very large upon
this head3 and suppose that great controversies may arise
either from the testament of the father, or the nature of the
inheritance, or the quality of the sons; as if the younger
son be a disciple of the wise men, and the elder not; if the
younger be made a proselyte‚ the elder a Gentile, &c But
in the instance now before uS, the complaint or controversy
is not about dividing, but about not dividing ; because the
firstborn most probably would not gratify the younger in
that thing.

The judges in that case was the bench of the Triumviri.
These were the δικασταὶ, πάρες, in the controversy, and de-
creed concerning the right or equity of dividing: and either
some were appointed by them, or some chosen by those
between whom the cause depended‚ as arbiters in the case,
and these were the μερισταὶ, dividers, those that took care as
