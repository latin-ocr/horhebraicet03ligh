the serpent3''

Ver. 43⁰: “On οὐ δύνασθε ἀκούειν τὸυ λόγου τὸν ἐμόν·
Because ye cannot lesem· my word] You may here distin-
guish λαλία and λόγος· so that λαλία may signify the manner
of speakiny, or phrases used in speeclz,· λόγος, the matter or
thing] spoken. Isa. xi. 43 “ Η6 shall smite the earth with the
rod of his mouth.” But they could not bear the smart of his
rod; they would not therefore understand the phraseology or
way of speech he used.

Ver. 44: Ἀυθρωποκτόνος ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς· Α murderer from the
beqimziny] ,ΠΨΦΝἾἎ *gn ΠΕἸἾ, for so the Hebrew idiom
would render ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς, he was a murderer from tlte days of
the creation. And so Christ, in saying this, speaks according
to the vulgar opinion, as if Adam fell the very first day of his
creation.

Ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ οὐχ ἕστηκεν· He abocle not in the trulla] I. He

out the way of lying.

when God had pleased to malge known his good will towards
the first man, partly fixing him in so honourable and happy
a station, partly commanding the angels that they should
minister to him for his good, Heb. i. ¹4³ the devil did not
abide in this truth, nor persisted in this will and command
of God. For he, envying the honour and happiness of man,
took this command of God concerning the angels' ministering
to him, in so much scorn and contempt, that, swelling with
most envenomed malice against Adam, and infinite pride
against God, he chose rather to dethrone himself from his
own glory and felicity‚ than he would bear Adam's continu-
ance in so noble a station, or minister any way to the hap-
piness of it. An angel was incapable of sinning either more
or less than by pride or malice.

Ver. 48: Σαμαρείτης εἷ σὺ, καὶ δαιμόνιον ἔχεις· Thou art α
Samaritam, and kase a davil] But what, I pray you, hath α
Samaritam to do with the court of your Temple? For this
