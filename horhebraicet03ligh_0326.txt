820⁷ Hebrew and Talmudieal [Oh. vii. 37.

Israel, in the feast of tabernacles, offers before thee seventy
bullocks for the seventy nations. Israel, therefore, say unto
thee, Ο eternal Lord, behold we offer seventy bullocks for
these3 it is but reasonable, therefore, that they should love
us; but. on the contrary, as it is written, ‘ For our love they
are our adversaries? The holy blessed God, therefore, saith
to Israel, ‘ Offer for yourselves on the eighth day! '’ A para-
ble. “ This is like a king, who made a feast for seven days,
and invited all the men in that province, for those seven days
of the feast: but when those seven days were past, he saith
to his friend, ⁶ We have done what is needful to be done
towards these lnen3 let thee and me return to enjoy together
whatever comes to hand, be it but one pound of flesh, or fish, or
herbs.’ So the holy blessed Grod saith to Israel, ⁶ The eighth
day shall be a feast or holy day,5 '³ Sco.

“ TheyZ offer seventy bullocks for the seventy nations,
to make atonement for them, that the rain may fall upon
the fields of all the world; for, in the feast of tabernacleS,

God determines what rains shall be for the year following.

Hence, therefore, this last day of the feast grew into such
esteem in that nation above the other days; because, on
the other seven days they thought supplications and sacri-
fices were offered not so much for themselves as θυι· the
nations of the world, but the solemnities of the eighth day
were wholly in their own behalf. And hence the deter-
mination and finishing of the feast when the seven days were
over, and the beginning, as it were, os a new one on the
eighth day. For,

the feast, but a festival day separately and by itself.
