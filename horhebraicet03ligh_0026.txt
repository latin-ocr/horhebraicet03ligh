20 Hebrew (md Tahnuclical [011. i. 17.

do not drink, he breaks the command about tithes and the
laws of his fathers. 7:747& γἾΠἾ Let Elias uoztie this lmot
when he comes.”

Ver. 17: Ἐν πνεύματι καὶ δυνάμει Ἠλίου· In the spirit and
power of Elias] I. The Baptist is Elias, as our Saviour was
David3 that is, the antitype, Jer. xxx. 93 Mal. iv. 53 Hos.
iii. 5, &c. It is less wonder that the Jews, from the words of
Malachi, should expect the personal coming of Elijah, since
there are not a few Christians that would be looking for the
same thing, although they have an angel in this place inter-
preting it otherwise, and our blessed Saviour elsewhere him-
self [Matt. xi. 14]; “ This is Elias which was for to come.'' But
they misunderstood the phrase of the “great and dreadful
day of the Lord ;” as also were deceived into the mistake by
the Greek version, “that Elias must come before the last
judgment.'”

ΙΙ. It is not said by the prophet Malachi, “ Behold Ι will
send you Elijah the Tishbicess’ but “Elijah the prophet?
whioha perhaps might be better rendered, “Behold I send
you a prophet Elijah.” And I may confidently say it. would
not be so wide from the sense and meaning of Malachi as the
Greek interpreters, who by a prodigious daringness in favour
of the J ewish traditions, have rendered it, Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀποστελῶ
ὑμῖν Ἠλίαν τὸυ Θεσβίτηυ· Ι send you Elt'jala the Tiskbite.

111. If I mistake not, “Elias the prophet” is but twice
mentioned (I mean in those very terms) throughout the
whole book of God: once in this place in Malachi, the other
in 2 Chron. xxi. 12. And in both those places I believe it is
not meant Elijah the Tishbite in his own person, but some
one in the spirit and power of him. That the words in
Malachi should be so understood, both the angel and our
Saviour teach us, and it seems very proper to be so taken in
that· place in the Chronicles.

IV. That great prophet that lived in Ahab's days is called
the Tishbz'te, throughout the whole story of him, and not the
prophet. Nor is he called the prophet, Luke iv. 25 (where yet
it is said, ‘ Eliseus the prophet') ; nor by St. ‚J ames, chap. v. 17.
For the very word ”2325le Tislzbz‘, which is his epithet, suffi-
ciently asserts his prophetie dignity when it denotes no other

a Leusden’s edition, vol. ii. p. 491.
