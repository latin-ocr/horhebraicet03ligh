Whilst I a little more narrowly consider that severe intor-
diction by which the Ν azarite was forbidden the total use os
the vine, not only that he should not drink of the wine, but
not so much as taste of the grape, not the pulp nor stone
of the grape, no, not the bark of the vine 3 I cannot but call

that had bcen forbidden to Adam, by the tasting of which he
sinned. The Jewish doctors positively affirm this without
any scruplez.

ΙΙ, Whether that law about the Nazarites had not some
reference to Adam while he was under that prohibition in
the state of innocency. For if the bodily and legal unclean-

in a most pure religion [Lam. iv. 7], be something in comme-
moration of the state of man bef01e his fall?

manded to be drunk at Jerusalem, and the cup of wine to be
drunk at the Passover. What must the Nazarite do in this
case? If he drink, he violates the command of his order3 if hc
