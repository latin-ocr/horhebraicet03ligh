(Jh. vii. 28, 35] Emereitatimzs upon St. John. 317

morable; in his second was the hope and expectation of the
nation. The Jews therefore who tell our Saviour here, that
“ when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is,” whether
they knew him to have been born at Bethlehem or no, yet by
his wonderful works they conceive this to have been the second
manifestation of himself: and therefore only doubt whether
he should be the Messiah or no, because they knew the place
[Nazareth] from whence he came3 having been taught by
tradition, that Messiah should come the second time from a
place perfectly unknown to all men.

Ver. 28: Ἀλλ’ ἔστιν ἀληθινὸς ὁ πέμψας με ὃν ὑμεῖς οὐκ οἴδατε·
He that sent me z's true, whom ye know not.] Ἀληθινὸς here must
be taken in the same sense wherein ῙὮΝ] is so often used
amongst the lawyers, to signify him whose word and testimony
in any thing may be taken.

‘⁵ Ther men of J udea ΓΞὈΝΞ may] be credited as to the
purity of the wine and the oil.'' Gloss: “ Even the people
of the land, the very vulgar sort, may be credited for the
purity of the wine and the oil‚ which is dedicated by them
to the altar in the time of the vintage or pressing.'’

Men not known by name or face to the priests, yet if they
offered wine or oil, were credited as to the purity and fitness of
either, from their place of habitation. There are numberless
instances of men, though perfectly unknown, yet that may be
credited, either as to tithes, or separating the T ramale, or
giving their testimony, &a To the same sense our Saviour,
chap. v. 31, “ If Ι bear witness of myselt', my witness is not
true;'⁷ i. e. in your judicatories it is not of any value with
you, where no one is allowed to be a witness for himself.
And in this place, “ ‘ He that hath sent me,’ although you
know him not, yet· ‘is he true, or worthy belief,7 however I
myself may not be so amongst you.'’
⁶ Ver. 35: Μὴ εἷς τὴν διασπορὰν τῶν (Ελλήνων, Sto. To the
disper-sed (aneon-9y the Gentiles, ἄοκ] Ι confess Ἕλληνες, in the
apostle's writings, does very frequently denote the Gentiles:
to which that of the Rabbins agrees well enough, ΠἾῬ mmm-1

here Ι would take Ἑλλήνων in its proper signification for the
