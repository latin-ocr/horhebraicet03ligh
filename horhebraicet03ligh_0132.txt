126 Hebrew and Talmudv'cal [Ch. xi. 46.

Simeon Ben -Jochai saith, He that is conversant &asyma in
the textual exposition of the law, hath a measure, which is not
a measure. He that is conversant in Misna, hath a measure,
from whence they receive a reward: but if he be conversant
in the Talmud, there is not a greater measure than this.
Always betake yourself to the Misna rather than the Tal-
mud. But R. J ose Ben R. Bon saith, This which thou sayest,
obtained before the Rabbi had mixed with it manifold tradi-
tions: but from the time that he mixed with it manifold
traditions, always have recourse to the Talmud rather than
to the Misna.’'

Now, Ι pray, who is he that, according to this tradition,
merits most the title of a doctor oscam, υομικοῦ or υομοδιὸασκά-
λουὲ Ηο that is conversant ΝἾΡΌΠ in the eoeposite'on and in-
terpretation of the written law, and the context of it, alas! he
doth but little ; and for all the oil and labour he hath spent,
hath only a measure, which is not a measure. But he that is
conversant in the Misna and Talmud‚ in the traditional doc-
trine or exposition of the traditional laW, he bears away the
bell [palmam fert]; he hath some reward for his pains, and is
dignified with the title of doctor.

ΙΙΙ. If there were any distinction betwixt νομικὸν and νομο-
διδάσκαλοι) (which I hardly believe), we may suppose it might
be this; either that the υομοδιδάσκαλος had his school and his
disciples, and the νομικὸς had none, or that the νομικὸς was
conversant in the Misna, or the plain and literal exposition of
traditions, and the νομοδιδάσκαλος, 111 the Talmud, or a more
profound and scholastic way of teaching.

However, be there this distinction betwixt them, or some
other, or indeed none at all, yet I presume they were both
doctors of traditions, and expounders of that which they called
the 0101 laW, in opposition to the scribes, whether amongst the
Jews or the Sadducees, who employed themselves in the text—
ual exposition of the laW.

Ver. 46: Καὶ αὐτοὶ ἑυὶ τῶν δακτύλων ὑμῶν οὐ προσψαύετε·
And ye yourselves touch not (the bur-dens) with one of your fin-
yers] That the νομικοὶ (as we have already said) were the
doctors of tradition& is a little confirmed by this, that what
our Saviour reproacheth them for were merely traditionals τ
