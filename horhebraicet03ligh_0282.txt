But Hierosol. Avodah Zarae tells us, “ R. Jacob Bar Acha,
in the name of R. Laza1·‚ saith, That the victuals of the
Guthites are allowed, if nothing of their wine or vinegar be
mingled amongst them? Nay, further, we meet with this
passage in Bab. Kiclduslcinst ΓΠΠἾὮ ΞἻΓιὈ nm “ lee un-
Zeavened bread of the &amites is allowed, and by that a man
may rightly enough keep the Passoverff' if the unleavened
bread for the Passover may 'oe had of the Samaritans, much
more common breacl. And grant that the Samaritans were
to the Jews as heathens, yet was it lawful for the J ew to par-
take of the edibles of the Gentiles, if there was no suspicion
that they had been any way polluted‚ nor been offered to
idols; as may be largely made out from Maimonides in his
treatise about forbidden meats. Which suspicion was alto-

gether needless as to the Samaritans3 because they and the .

Jews in a manner agreed upon the same things as clean 01·
unclean, and they were very near as free from idolatry.

Ver. 9: Οὐ γὰρ συγχρῶνται Ἰουδαῖοι Σαμαρείταις· For the
Jews have no dealz'nffs with tloe Samaritana] Ι. That transla-
tion, the Jews have no dealinys with tlte Samaritam, which the
French and English follow, seems to stretch the sense of the
word beyond what it will well bear: for, 1. Granting the Sama—
ritans were mere heathens, (which some of the Rabbins have
affirmed,) yet did not this forbid the Jews having any kind of
dealings with them3 for they did not refuse inerchandising
with any of the Gentile nations whatever. See Nehem.
xiii. 16, &a 2. But if the Samaritans were 1²·an ἾἾἾλ true
proselytes, as R1.Akiba11 asserts‚ or ‘as the lsraelites in all
things,’ as Rabban Simeon Ben Gamaliel saith of themg;
then much more might the Jews have dealing with them.

ΙΙ. That version, non utuntur Judoea· Samaritis, as Beza; or,
non co-utzmtur, as the Vulgar‚ hardly reacheth the sense of
the word, 01· comes fully up to the truth of the thingh.

“ Iti is lawful to eat the unleavened bread of the Samari-
tans, nor is there any suspicion as to their leavened bread
