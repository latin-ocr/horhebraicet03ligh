servants or boys led in singing, we may judge from this fol-
lowing passage ε

“ Theyb asked R. Chaijam Bar Ba, ‘ How <loth it appear,
that he who heareth and (loth not answer performs his
dutyss' ‘From this, saith he, &⁸:525 ΓΞΞἻ ΓἾΞΠ ζὶδὲἾ

be he that comem, '³⁴¹¹ mm ΓἺΌἾΝ ἶἾέἪἾ and they cmswer,
I n the name of the Lorcl .· and they both perform their dut-v.=

Midras Tillin leaves these last words ’Ἢ mm wholly out.
For so that hath it: “The men of Jerusalem say from within,
ἃ). ΠΏἾΒἿΠ ‘'n'' Nl& Save ‘ess now, O Lorcl, we beseecla thee.

Prosper με now, Lord, we besem-la thee. The men of Jerusalem
say from within, &217 ἾἾἾΞ Blessed be lm that comella .· and tho
men of J udea say from without, We have blessed you out of
the house of the L01·d.”

I will not confidently assei-t that these men had any ill
design when they thus mangled this famous clause; but
surely there is at least some ground of suspicion that they
hardly refer the words to the right object. R. Solonion as—
suredly doth not. For, “ So it ought to be said (saith hc)
to those that bring their first-fruits, and go up to the
feasts.”

1. 'Po come is ostentimes the same with them as to teaclz ,·
“ Ifc any one shall come in his own name, him ye will receive :³⁹
i. e. If any one shall teach. And so it is frequently in the
Jerusalem Talmud, concerning this or the other Rabbin, ΝΠΝ
he came, and Nn& '12 when lm comella. Which if it be not
to be understood of such a one teaching, Ι confess I am at a
loss what it should mean else.

2. Those doctors did not come and teach in the name of
the Lord, but either in their own name, or in the name
of some father of the traditions. Hence nothing more fami-
liar with them, than “ R. N. in the name of R. N. saith :²³
as every leaf, I may say almost every line of their writings
witnesses. If, therefore, by cutting short this clause, t-hey would
be appropriating to themselves the blessing of the people,
