of Moses, why then is not his book put in the first place? the

answer is, ῙΞἾῖῬΠΠὩ Νἰῗ ΝΠἾΞὩἾἻΞὮ, They do not bfgyin with
venyeance or affliction ‚· and such is that Book of Job. They
reply‚ mmmm ³0] ,ΠΤἻ Ruth also beqiozs with affliction, viz.
with the story of a famine, and the death of Elimelech's sons.
“ But 11101 was (say they) ΠἿἾΠΝ ΓῬΒ ΠἯἻ ΠὋὩἾἾΞΞ sm
affliction that had α joyful emliny.” So they might have said
of the book and affliction of Job too. We see it is disputed
there, why the Book of Ruth should be placed the first in that
rank, ancl not the Book of -J ob. But we might- inquire,
whether the Book of Psalms ought not to have been placed
the first, rather than the Book of Ruth.

IV. In this passage at present before 110, who would think
otherwise but that our Saviour alludes to 1110 common and
most known partition of the Bible3 and although he name
the Psalms only, yet that under that title he includes that
whole volume. For we must of necessity say, that either 110
excluded all the books of that third division excepting the
Book of Psalms, which is not probable; or that he included
them under the title of the Proplwts, which was not cus-
tomary; or else that under the title of the Psalms he com-
prehended all the rest. That he did not exclude 1110111,
reason will tell us3 for in several books of that division is
he himself spoken of, as well as in the Psalms: and that he
did not include them in the title of the Prophets reason also
will dictate: because we would not suppose him speaking dif-
ferently from the common and received opinion of that nation.
There is very little question, therefore, but the apostles
mightf understand him speaking with the vulgar3 and by
the Psalms to have meant all the books os that volume, those
especially wherein any thing was written concerning himself.
For let it be granted that Ruth, as to the time of the history
and the time of its writing, might challenge to itself the first
place in order (and it is that kind of priority the Gemarists
are arguing), yet‚'eertainly‚ amongst all those books that
