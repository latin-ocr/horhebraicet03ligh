said, ‘Thou shalt go intog thy tents,’ is to be thus under-

walls of Jerusalem ; but by no means into thine own house? ''

II. Was it lawful then to return home on the second day
of the feast? No, it was not. For on that day was the
general appearance in the court, and presentment of their
offerings. And this seems hinted by R. Elhanani in another
Gloss upon the place newly cited: ‘⁶ There were two rea-
sons (saith he) of their lodging in Jerusalem: the one
because of the feast day3 the other because of the ῑἎἾΡ
