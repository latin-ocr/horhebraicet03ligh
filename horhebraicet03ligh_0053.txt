“ R. J udahu ordained R. Levi Ben Susi for a doctor to the
Simonians. They made him a great chair‚ and placed him in it.
Then propounded questions to him [occasioned from Deut.
xxv. 9], mehir-t *mn-r rim* rima If thy brother-’s wife

as require a most cunning sophister to unriddle them.

“There'‘ is a story of a certain disciple that came and in-

to Joshua, ‘ Dost thou affirm it to be a thing of pleasure 2³ He
saith unto him, ‘ N 0.' ‘ Stand upon thy feet,' saith the other,
‘ that they may witness against thee.’ Rabban Gamaliel was
then sitting and expounding. [Probably this very article]
R. Joshua stood on his feet till all the people cried out to
him [acclamaret] They say to R. Hospith the interpreter,
‘Dismiss the people.’ They say to R. Zenon the Chazam
‘Say, Begin ye3' and they said, ‘Begin thou ς’ so all the
people rose up and stood on their feet. They said unt-o him,
‘Who is it thy wickedness hath not touched 3³ They went
out straightway and made R. Eleazar Ben Azariah president
of the council. Du) *1³07 ΒἾῘῬΟΞΕ) ,7723 how many seats were
