of this Pharisee ; and although our Saviour useth that term,
which in the J ewish langu‘age plainly enough intimates the
necessity of being born from heaven, yet cannot he easily get
off from his first prejudice about the Israelitish generation:
“ Whereas the Israelites, as they are Israelites‚ have a right
to be admitted into the kingdom of the Messiah, do you
therefore mean by this expression of yours‚ that it is neces-
sary for any to enter a second time into his mother’s womb,
that he may be an Israelite anew 3’'

He knew and acknowledged, as we have already said, that
there must be a sort of a new birth in those that come over
to the J ewish religion; but he never dreamt of any new pro-
selytism requisite in one'that had been born an Israelite.
He could not therefore conceive the manner of a new birth,

had taught that towards the participation of the benefits to
be had by the Messiah, it is of little or of no value for a man
to be born of the seed of Abraham, or to be originally an
Israelita unless he was also born ἄνωθεν, 01· from above‚· so
he now further teacheth him, that this admission is not to be
obtained buta by an absolute renunciation of Judaism, and
being baptized into the profession of the gospel. For the
tenor of Christian baptism runs pointblank against J udaism.
The J ewish religion taught justification by works 3 but evan-

sinner to look elsewhere for remissiori of sins: so that to a
Jew baptism was indispensably necessary, in order to his
admission into the kingdom of the Messiah, that by that
