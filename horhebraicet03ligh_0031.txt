Ch. i. 29, 3¹2] Exercitatz'ons upon St. Luke. 25

meon Ben Lachish saithn, The names of angels went up by
the hand of Israel out of Babylon. For before it is said,
Then flew one of the seraphim unto me 3 the seraphim stood

⁴ before him, Isa. vi; but afterward the man Gabriel, [Dan.

ix. 21‚] and Michael your prince‚” [Dan. x. 21.]

The angel calls Zacharias back to Dan. ix, where the
prediction concerning the coming of Messiah was foretold by
Gabriel.

Ver. 29: Διεταράχθη, &c chcs troubled, tgna] I. It was
very rare and unusual for men to salute any women3 at
least if that be true in Kidclcoskiff. Rabh J udah‚ the presi-
dent of the academy of Pombeditha, went to Rabh Nachman,
rector of the academy of Neharde, and after some talk
amongst themselves, “ Saith Rabh Nachman, Let my daugh-
ter Doneg bring some drink, that we may drink together.
Saith the other, Samuel saith, We must not use the ministry
of a woman. But this is a little girl, saith Nachman. The
other answers, But Samuel saith, We ought not to use the
ministry of any woman at all. Wilt- thou please, saith Nach-
man, to salute Lelith my wife? But, saith he, Samuel saith,
The voice of a woman is filthy nakedness. But, saith Nach-
man, thou mayest salute her by a messenger. To whom the
other3 Samuel saith, They do not salute any woman. Thou
mayest salute her, saith Nachman, by a proxy her husband.
But Samuel saith, saith he again, They do not salute a
woman at all.”

ΙΙ. It was still much more rare and unusual to give such
a kind of salutation as this, Χαῖρε, κεχαριτωμένη, Hail, {hou
that art lzifyhlys favoured‚ ΠἿἾἾὩΠ rm 01· 2 ΠἾἾἾΥΞΠ nm& by
which title Gabriel had saluted Daniel of old: with this
exception P, that it was terror enough so much as to see an
angel.

Ver. 32: ’Υἱὸς ὑψίστου κληθήσεται· Skall be called the Son qf
the Hiybest] That is, “he shall be called the Messiah:”
for Messiak and tlze Son of God are convertible terms.
Whether the angel expressed it by 3543? ἾΞ or ΠἿΞἎ a: is
uncertain. It is certain that both these words were very
much in use in that nation. ῙἹἾῙῬΏ very commonly in use in
