176 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xvi. 29, 31.

noting‚ Rev. xiv. 10, “ Shall be tormented with fire and brim-
stone, in the presence of the holy eingeis, and in the presence
of the Lamb.''

Ver. 29: ’Έχουσι Μωσέα καὶ τοὺς προφήτας· They have Moses
and the prophets] The kistorical books also are comprehended
under the title of the Prophts, according to the common ac-
ceptation of the Jews, and the reading in their synagogues:
“ Allp the books of the Prophets are eight; Joshua, Judges,
Samuel, the Kings, J eremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah‚ and the twelve.”
So the Gemara also reckons themq. So we find Ὀκτάτευχος
προφητικὴ, the Octateuck of the Prophets‚ as well as Πευτάτευχος
Μωσαϊκὴ, tke Pentateuck qs Moses, in Photius¹3 of which we
have spoken elsewhere.

But are the ΠῈἾΓὉ the Hayioyraplza emluded, when men-
tion is made only of the law and the prophets? Our Saviour
speaks after the usual manner of their reading Μοεεε (md the
Prophets in their synagogues8; where every ordinary person,
even the most rude and illiterate, met with them, though he
had neither Moses nor the prophets nor the Hayioyrapha at his
own house. indeed, the ΕἿΞἹΠΞ or the koly writinys, were not
read in the synagogues (for what reason I will not dispute in
this place), but they were, however, far from being rejected
by the people, but accounted for divine w1·itings‡‚ which mayt
be evinced‚ besides other things, even from the very name.
Our Saviour therefore makes no mention of them, not because
he lightly esteems them, but because Moses and the prophets
were heard by every one every sabbath day; and so were not
the Haqioqrapha.

Ver. 31 : Οὐδὲ ἐάν τις ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῇ, πεισθήσονται· Neitlzer
will they be persuaded, thouyh one rose from the dead] Any
one may see how Christ points at the infidelity of the Jews,
even after that himself shall have risen again. From whence
it is easy to judge what was the design and intention of this
parable.
