Ch. xxii. 44] Exercitations upon St. Lulce. 207

a garden in a visible shape; it is not absurd to imagine, he did
so now to the second Adam, in a garden, in a visible shape.

ΙΙ. This our evangelist tells us concerning his temptation
in the wilderness, that¹¹ “ when the devil had ended all the
temptation‚ he departed from him, ἄχρι καιροῦ, for a season.’'
Here he takes the season to retur1103 and I see no reason
why he should not at this time, as well as in the wilderness,
assume some visible shape. Then, indeed, he addressed him-
self in a charming and grateful shape‚ to have enticed and
deceived him3 but now in a frightful and horrid one, to have
amazed and terrified him. He had already experienced how
vain a thing it was to go about to cheat and allure him : what
remained therefore but to shake his mind (if possible) with
fright. and terror?

III. For when he had no greater invention in his whole
storehouse‚ by which he could distress and shake the minds
of mortals, than the horrid apparition of himself, none will
conceive he would neglect this engine, that if it could be, he
might disturb his soul through his eye. That, therefore,
which the Jews feign or dream about Solomon, that he saw
the angel of death (that is, the devil) gnashing his teeth, and·
that a disciple of Rabbi did so tooP‚ I suppose acted in good
earnest here; namely, that Christ saw the devil, that old
dragon, gaping at him with all horror he could put on. And
in this sense would I understand that of the “ messenger of
Satan buffeting the apostleq :²² viz. that the devil did appear
visibly to him in some frightful shape, to afflict and terrify
him. And perhaps that vehement desire he had to sift the
disciples (ver. 31) respects this same thing, namely, that he
might be permitted to assault them with such kind of
affrightments.
