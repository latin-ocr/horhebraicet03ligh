him.’ Which he also will expoundx‚ not osy the weakness
and impotency, but the perfection and obedience, of the Son
that he so doeth.

Ver. 25: ’Έρχεται ὥρα καὶ νῦν ἐστιν, ὅτε οἱ νεκροὶ ἀκούσονται,
&c. The bour is comi-ny, and now is, when the dead shall hear, αέα]
The Jews, as we have said before, looked for the resurrection
of the dead at the coming of Messiah: and that truly‚ and
with great reason, though it was not to be in their sense.

The vision of Ezekiel about the dry bones living, chap.
xxxvii, and those words of Isaiah, ‘⁸ Thy dead men shall live,”
&c., chap. xxvi. 19, suggest to them some such thing, although
they grope exceedingly in the dark as to the true interpreta-
tion >of this matter.

That of R. Eliezer is well enough3 Ε““’Π” ῑΞἾΝ mm& *1237
The people of the earth [the Gentiles] do not live: which some-
what agrees with that of the apostle‚ Eph. ii. 1, “Ye were
dead in trespasses and sins.'' Nor does that of J eremiah Bar
Abbaa sound much differently: ‘⁶ The dry bones [Ezek. xxxvii]
are the sons of men, ΠἾΒῬΞΠ ΓΡΠἾῖῖΠῙὯ 317: ΓΝἱζ) in whom
is not the moisture of the Zaw.''

It is true, “many bodies os the saints arose” when Christ
himself arose, Matt. xxvii. 52: but as to those places in
Scripture which hint the resurrection of the dead at his
coming, I would not understand them so much of these, as
the raising the Gentiles from their spiritual death of sin, when
they lay in ignorance and idolatry, to the light and life of the
gospel. Nor need we wholly expound Ezckiel's dry bones
recovered to life, of the return 'of the tribes of Israel from
their captivity, (though that may be included in it3) but
rather, or together with that, the resuscitation of ‘ the Israel
of God' (that is, those Gentiles that were to believe in the
Messiah,) from their spiritual death.

The words in Rev. xx. 5, ‘⁶ This is the first resurrection,’'
do seem to confirm this. Now what, and at what time, is
this resurrection? When the great Angel of the covenant,
Christ, had bound the old dragon with the chains of the
gospel, and shut him up that he should no more seduco the
nations, ἵνα μὴ πλανήσῃ τὸ, ἔθνη, by lying wonders, oracles,
