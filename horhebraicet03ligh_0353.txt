ΙΙ. He describes the evil shepherds of the people under
a triumvirate, ver. 8: “Three shepherds also I cut off in one
month‚’' &c3 i.e. the Pharisees‚ the Sadducees, and the
Essenes3 which interpretation though it cannot but sound very
unpleasingly in J ewish yearS, yet is it what seems abundantly
confirmed, both from the context and the history of things.
They therefore would turn the edge of the prophecy another
way, the Geznarists understanding the three skephercls of Moses,
Aaron, and Miriams: Jarchi would have it the house of
Ahab, the house of Ahaziah, and his brethren: Kimehi, the
sons of Josiah, Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, and Zedekiah. Aben

Pharisaism hath its being amongst the Jews to this very
day?

Ans. So indeed it is said, that under the gospel, the na-

should not be an infant in age, or one under age, in the
new Jerusalem, lsa. lxv. 20: whereas we find enough of
war in every generation, and that infancy or ignorance in
divine things abounds still. But nevertheless God had done
his part towards the accomplishment of such prophecies;
namely, he had brought in the gospel of peace and the gospel
of light, that nothing should be wanting on his side that
peace might reign on the earth, and infancy in divine things
should be no more. So did this great Shepherd bring in the
evangelical doctrine, the oracle of truth and religion, which
did so beat down and confound all the vain doctrines and in-
