mention any thing of Christ, 1116 Book of Psalms deservedly
obtains the first place; so far that in the naming of this the
rest may be understood. So St. MattheW, chap. xxvii. 9,
under the name of Jeremialz„ comprehends that whole volume
of tlte Prophets, because he was placed the first in that rank :
which observation we have made in notes upon that place.

Ver. 4 5 : Τότε διήνοιξεν αὐτῶν τὸν υοῦυ· Τ hen opened lm their
understansliwffi] When it is said, that by the imposition of the
hands of the apostles the gift of tongues and of prophecy was
conferred (⁶⁶ they spake with tongues, and they prophesied,’'
Acts xix. 6), by ¹ prophecy’ nothing may be better understood
than this very thing, that the minds of such were opened,
that they viziqlzt understand the Scriplures : and perhaps their
‘speaking with tongues’ might look this way in the first
notion of it, viz, that they could understand the original
wherein the Scriptures were writ.

Ver. 50: Ἕως εἰς Βηθανίαν· As far as Bethany] How
many difficulties arise here!

I. This very evangelist (Acts i. 12) tells us, that when the
disciples came back from the place where our Lord ascended,
“ they returned from mount Olivet‚ distant from Jerusalem
a sabbath day's ι10111·116)].” But now the town of Bethansq
was about fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem, John xi. 18, that
is, double a sabbath day’s journey.

Il. J osephus tells us that the mount of Olives was but
five furlongs from the city ; and a sabbath day’s journey was
seven furlongs and a half. ‘⁶ Aboutg that time there came
to Jerusalem a certain Egyptian, pretending himself a pro-
phet, and persuading the people that they would go out with
him to the mount of Olivess‘o καὶ τῆς πόλεως ἄντικρυς κείμενον
ἀπέχει στάδια πέντε; which, bein-q situated on the from of the
city, is distant five sandow-§.³⁵ These things are all true:
1. That the mount of Olives lay but five furlongs' distance
from Jerusalem. 2. That the town of Bethany was fifteen
furlongS. 3. That 1116 disciples were brought by Christ as
far as Betlmny. 4. That when they returned from the mount
’ of Olives they travelled more than five furlongs. And, 5.
Returning from Bethany, they travelled b'ut a sabbath day's
