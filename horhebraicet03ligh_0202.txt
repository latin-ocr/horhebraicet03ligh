when indeed all these ineffable benefits were dispensed in the
midst of her. Nor indeed were those times described before-
hand with more remarkable characters as to what God would
do, than theyi were with black and dreadful indications as to
the perverseness and obstinacy of that people. They were the
best of times, and the worst generation lived in them. In
those last days of that city were ‘perilous times,’ 2 Tim. iii.1 :
⁸ departing from the faith‚’ 1 Tim. iv. 1 : ⁶ Sccffers' of religion,
2 Pet. iii. 3 : in a word, ‘ many antichrists,’ Ι John ii. 18. So
far was Jerusalem and the nation of the Jews from knowing
and acknowledging the things that belonged unto their
peace.

VE R. 1 ε Οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς σὺν τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις·
The chief priests <md tlte scribes witlt tlte etalem] So it is in
Mark xi. 27: but in Matt. xxi. 23, it is ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ πρεσβύ-
τεροι τοῦ λαοῦ, tlte chief priests ancl elders oftlze people. Now
the question is, who these &Mers should be, as they are distin-
guished from the chief priests and the scribes. The Sanhedrim
consisted chiefly of priests, Levites, and israelites, although
the original precept was for the priests and Levites only.

“kThe command is, that the priests and Levites should be

of the great council; as it is said, Thou shalt go unto the
priests and Levites: ism &37 mm but if such be not to be

found, ἾΠἾὮ ΓΠ ἾἻΠ ‘mum' ῦίῗῆ) 'tw ibis& although, they
were all Israelites, behold, it is allowed.”

N one will imagine that there ever was a Sanhedrim wherein
there were Israelites only, and no priests or Levites; nor, on
the other hand, that there ever was a Sanhedrim wherein
there were only priests and Levites, and no Israelites. The
γραμματεῖς, therefore, or the scribes, seem in this place to de-
note either the Levites, or else, together with the Levites,
those inferior ranks of priests who were not the ἀρχιερεῖς, or
ckiqf priests: and then the πρεσβύτεροι, eidem, may be the
Israelites, or those elders of the laity that were not os the
Levitical tribe. Such a one was Gamaliel the present presi—

dent os the Sanhedrim, and Simeon his son, of the tribe of
J udah.
