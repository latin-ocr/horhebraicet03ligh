D'l' ΨἸἻῬ the consecration of α day. My mother was a very
old woman, who once sold her hair-lace, and bought wine
with it, for me to consecrate a day with.’ There is a tradi-
tion. When she died, she bequeathed to him three hundred
hogsheads of wine: and when he died, he bequeathed three
thousand hogsheads to his sons.” The Gloss is: He that is
constant in the consecration of a day, by the merit of that
obtains wine.

Ἀρχιτελώνης· Chias among] the publicana] A few things
concerning the degree of publicans:

Ι. The lexicographer tells us, that they called those the
greater publicans who redeomed at a certain fixed price the
tax and other revenues of the Romans: these were commonly
called the Daciarz'i 1'.

ΙΙ. “ These-⁴³ are persons not capable of giving any public
testimony, ΓΟΞἾὩΠἹ ΓΝΞΞΠἾ ΓὩΤἾ shepherds, eman-cors, and
publieans.” Upon which words R. Gaon hath this passage:
“The Rabbins do not exclude the publicans upon the account
that they exact more than is appointed to them3 for then
they would be the same with ΓΝΞἎ mador-50 But when the
king lays a tax upon the Jews, to be required of every one
according to the proportion of their estates, these publicans,
in whose power it is to value every one's estate, will favour
some in the mitigation of their tax, and burden others beyond
all measure.”

ΙΙΙ. There were publicans (to omit those who collected
the taxes in every town) who stood at gates and bffidges, re-
quiring tribute of all passengers, coneerning whom we meet
with something in ›Schabbatlc 1. Where there is also mention

of 'prop ΞΣῚὩἾ ῙἮἻᾹ ΒΞἹΕ) the φθαῖεν and the [esser publicem.
Concerning whom the Gloss speaks thus ς “ Sometimes there
is α yreater publicaoz, to whom it is very grievous to stand at
the bridge all the day long: he therefore substitutes an infe-
rior or {esser pubbican.’' Let us take this story out of this
same tra0t11.
