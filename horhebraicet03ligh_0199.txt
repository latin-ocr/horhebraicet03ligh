The fifth part ”was so stated and doereed, that, 1, so far
they ought to go upon the account of a command. 2. No
man is bound by the law to go further. But, 3, he may do
more, if he please, on his own accord. Which this Zacchaeus
did in a large and generous measure. The restitution of four-
fold for his sycophancy agreed with the law about theft.

Ver. 9: “On σήμερον σωτηρία τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ ἐγένετο’ This
day is salvation come to this homa] It is said, ver. 7, ‘⁴ That
they all murmured that Christ was gone to be guest with a
man that is a sinner.'' What then did they think of the
house itself that belonged to this sinner? Do we think they
would enter in, when they despised any thing that belonged
to publicans? Perhaps that expression σταθεὶς δὲ Ζακχαῖος
εἶπε, Zacclzceus stood and said, may seem to hint that he came
forth, and stood talking with those that were without doors,
and would not enter. However, if we well consider how
meanly they accounted of the house of a publicari, we may
the more easily understand what the meaning of that expres-
sion is, Tln's day is salvatz'on come to this house.

Καθότι καὶ αὐτὸς υἱὸς Ἀβραάμ ἐστιν· Ροφτιεπῑασίι as lae also is
a son qf Abraham] That is, say most, the son of Abraham
bysaitlz; which indeed is most true. But I doubt, however,
that this is not directly the sense of these words. For Ι
question whether the Jews knew of any kind of relation to
Abraham but that which was according to the flesh, and by
way of stock and offspring. The son of Abraham bys saith was
a notion unknown; and I scarce believe our Saviour would
speak to them in an unintelligible dialect. '1¹0 which we may
add, that if it had been said αὐτὸς υἱὸς Ἀβραὰμ ἐγένετο (as it
is ἐγένετο in the former clause) we might the more easily have
inclined to that sense, and applied it to his conversion, by
which he was made a son of Abraham by saith. It would
argue that his relation to Abraham was changed, and be-
come other than what it was before, so as ἐγένετο, in the
former clause, argued the altered condition of the house: but
whereas it is said, υἱὸς Ἀβραάμ ἐστιν, ke ‘is‚’ and not lae ‘ is
made‚' α son of Abraham, I would take it in the same sense
with that, chap. xiii. 16, “This woman being a daughter of
