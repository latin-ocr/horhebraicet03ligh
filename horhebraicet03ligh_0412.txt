We may take notice of what is said in Avodak Zarakss.

that the passage concerns the plebeians or laics, who having
taken upon themselves any religious rule of life, go back
again from that profession ε they do not admit them ΠἸἾΞΠζῬ
into that order and society again. VVhether therefore those
that fell off from the gospel, returning to their J udaism again,
were ever admitted into the J ewish church after they had
voluntarily forsaken it, might be an inquiry. But these things

There was, in truth, a twofold epocha of the persecution of
the apostolical church, namely, both before that apostasy of
which we have such frequent mention, and also after it. Our
Saviour had foretold the apostasy in that tremendous parable
about the unclean spirit cast out, and returning again with
seven worse. “ So shall it be also (saith he) unto this wicked
generation‚'’ Matt. xii.45. The footsteps of this we may dis-
cern almost in every epistle of the apostles.

It is worthy observation, that of 2 Thess ii. 3: “ The day
of the Lord shall not come, except there come a falling away
first, and that man of sin be revealed.” The day of the Lord
here spoken of was that wherein Christ should come and
reveal himself in that remarkable vengeance against Jerusa-
lem and the Jewish nation‚ of which kind of expression we
shall say more 011 chap. xxi. 22. The ‘apostasy' or ‘falling
away,' and revelation of ‘ the man of sin‚' was to precede that
day: which might be easily made out by a history of those
times, if Ι were to do the business either of a historian or a
chronologer.

When therefore the severe and cruel persecution was first
raised by the unbelieving Jews before this falling away of ,
Christians, it must needs be greatly increased afterward by
them and the apostates together: which distinction we may
easily observe out of this verse.
