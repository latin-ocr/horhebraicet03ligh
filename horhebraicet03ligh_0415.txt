Ch. xvi. 10.] Exercitations upon St. Jolm. 409

ner. And this is the great mystery of the gospel, that sinners
are justified not only through the grace and mere compassion
and mercy of God, but through divine justice and righteous-
ness too, that is, through the righteousness of Christ, who is
J ehovah, ‘⁶ the Lord our Righteousness.’'

Andk the Spirit of truth when he came did reprove and in-
struct the world concerning these two great articles of saith,
wherein the Jews had so mischievously deceived themselves ;
that is, concerning true saving saith, saith in Christ3 and also
concerning 'the manner or formal cause of justification‚ viz.
the righteousness of Christ.

But then, how can we form the argument? “ I go unto the
Father3 therefore the world shall be convinced of my justify-

ence or obediential righteousness to God.

God had created man, that he might obey his Maker:
which when he did not do, but being led away by the devil
grew disobedient, where was the Creator’s glory? The devil
triumphs that the whole human race in Adam had kicked
against God, proved a rebel, and warred under the banners
of Satan. It was necessary, therefore, that Christ, clothing
himself in the human nature, should come into the world and
vindicate the glory of God, by performing an entire obedience
due from mankind and worthy of his Maker. He did what
weighed down¹ for all the disobedience of all mankind, I may
