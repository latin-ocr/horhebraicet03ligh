Λῃσταῖς περιέπεσεν· He fell among] tltieves] It is With great
confidence I see, but upon what foundation I cannot- see, that
the. commentators generally make Adummim the scene of this
robbery above all other places. It is true, the road betwixt
Jerusalem and J ericho was dangerous enough; and for that
reason (as is commonly believed) there was placed a band of
soldiers “ betwixtO AElia and J ericho? for the safeguard of
passengers: but whereas it is said that the place is called
Adummim, i. e. α place of reduess,f1·01n the blood that was
spilt by robbers there, this seems to have very little force in
it: because the place had that name of Adummim even inp
J oshua's dayS, when we can hardly suppose the times to have
been so pestered with robberies as they were whenq our Sa-
viour uttered this parable: see J osh. xv. 7, where if we con-

keeper of sheep, though he was an Israelite: now was this
wounded man such a one? or did ye think ye should have
contracted some pollution by touching one half dead? The
word ἀντιπαρῆλθεν, passed by ou the other side, seems to hint as
if they passed by him, keeping their distance from him: let
them tell the reason themselves. For my part, I would impute
it wholly to the mere [puro puto] want of charity.

Ver. 33 ε Σαμαρείτης δέ τις· But α certain Samaritam] Otr

the Samaritam .· that is, so as to be obliged by them for any
