of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be ficffilled :’'
and what then? in what sense is this word ἄχρι, until, to be
understood? Let every one have his conjecture, and let me be
allowed mine. I am well assured our Saviour is discoursing
about the fall and overthrow of Jerusalem; but Ι doubt,
whether he touches upon the restoration of it: nor can Ι see
any great reason to affirm, that the times of the Gentiles will
be fulfilled before the end of the world itself. But as to this
controversy, I shall not at present meddle with it. And yet,
in the mean time, I cannot but wonderthat the disciples,
having so plainly heard these things from the mouth of their
master, what concerned the destruction both of the place and
nation, should be so quickly asking, “ Lord, wilt thou at this
time restore the kingdom to Israel Ξ” Nor do I less wonder to
find the learned Beza expounding the very following verse
after this manner: ‘⁴ Then shall there be the signs in the sun,
&c.; that is, after those times are fulfilled, which were
allotted for the salvation of the Gentiles, and vengeance upon
the Jews, concerning which St. Paul discourses copiously.'’
Rom. xi. 25, &cz when, indeed, nothing could be said clearer
for the confutation of that exposition, than that of ver. 323
“Verily, I say unto you, This generation shall not pass
away till all be fulfilled.'' It is strange this should be no
more observed, as it ought to have been, by himself and
divers others, when, in truth, these very words are as a
gnomon to the whole chapter. All the other passages of
the chapter fall in with Matt. xxiv and Mark xiii, where we
have placed those notes that were proper; and shall repeat
nothing here. Which method I have taken in several places
in this evangelist, where he relates passages that have been
related before, and which I have had occasion to handle
as I met with them.
