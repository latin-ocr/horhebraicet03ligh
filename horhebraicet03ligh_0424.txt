the disciples forsook him, and fled.” So that probably ‘ Peter
and that other disciple’ was amongst the number when it is
said they allsted. The transition of our evangelist therefore
seems to teach us that neither ‘Peter nor the other disciple'
followed Christ to Annas's house3 but being surprised and
confounded with a very great sear, hid themselves fora while;
and (not till after some time) recollecting themselves, they
put foi-ward amongst the crowd to Caiaphas's hall, or else
came thither after them.

II. Annas alone could determine nothing judicially con-
cerning Christ: for when an inquiry must be made concerning
his disciples, and the nature of his doctrines, when witnesses
must be produced pro and con, this necessarily required a ses-
sion of the Sanhedrim, He sent him therefore to CaiaphaS,
where the Sanhedrim also was3 and the evangelist lets the
mention of that alone till he came to relate their way of
proceeding.

But why, or by what right, should Annas be absent from
the Sanhedrim? could there be any right or legal proceeding
in the great council, if the whole number of seventy-one elders
were not complete? Let Maimonides give the answerm: “ It
is not necessary that the whole bench of seventy-one should
all sit together in their places in the Temple; but when it is
necessary for them all to meet, let them be called together.

any business of his own, he may go out and do his affairs and
return again. This provision is made, that there might never
be fewer than twenty-three sitting together during the whole
session. If any have occasion to go forth, let him look about him
and see if there be twenty-three of his colleagues in the court,
then he may go out 3 if not, he must stay till some other enter.'’
We give another reason os Annas's absence by and by.
