iv EPISTLE DEDICATORY.

till Ι have forgot myself, and remember no more what Ι am. But
since your humanity hath been such as cannot be fully spoken out,
let me comprise the whole matter in this short compendium 3

that my family had perished‚ if Gocl's mercy, by the means of your
compassion‚ had Ποῖ saved it.

What shall Ι render to the Lord for all his benefits? and what to
your Graoe for so great a one? But can such a one as Ι think of
making returns to God- or you‘.l Let God himself, the Father of
mercies‚ (since Ι cannot) become your reward : and by an addition,
of his mercy, make me capable of rendering him myself 3 grant that
Ι mighfi be wholly his, and he yours. Ι pray that he would long
preserve, protect, and direct your Grace, and ab length make you
everlastingly happy. This, from the heart and without ceasing, is
the prayer of,

Most Reverend Faffler,
Your Grace‘s most humble

and most devoted servant,

J OHN LIGHTFOOT.
