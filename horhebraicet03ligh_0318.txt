312 Hebrew and Talmmlz'cal [Oh. vii. 2.

“ Atu the close of the first day of the feast, they went down
into the Court of the Women, and there prepared a great
stage.'' [That is, benches on which the women stood above,
and the men below] “'Grolden candlesticks were there'' fixed
to the walls: “over these were golden cups, to which were
four ladders set3 by which four of the younger priests went
up, having bottles in their hands that contained a hundred
and twenty logs, which they emptied into every cup. Of the
rags of the garinents and girdles of the priests, they made
wicks to light those Ia1nps3 and there was not a street
throughout all Jerusalem that did not shine with that
light.''

¹‘ The religious and devout danced before them, having
lighted torches in their hands, and sang songs and doxolo-
gies. The Levites with hemps, psalteries‚ cymbals, and other
instrumente of music without number, stood upon those fifteen
steps by which they went down from the Court of the WVomen,
according to the fifteen psaltns of degrees, and sang. Two
priests also stood in the upper gate, which goes down from
the Court of Israel to the Court of the Women, with two
trumpets in their hands. ἾΞἎ Νᾪ 'lmen tlte ccclv crew [or
the president gave his signal]‚ the trumpets sounded: when
they came to the tenth step, they sounded again: when they
came to the court they sounded: when they came to the
pavement they sounded: and so went on sounding the trum-
pets till they came to the east gate of the court. WVhen they
came thither, they turned their faces from the east to west,
and said, ⁶ Our fathersx in this place, turning their backs upon
the Temple, and their faces towards the east, worshipped the
sun3 but we turn our faces to God,² '² &Q

‘⁶ T hey Rabbins have a tradition. Some of them while they
were dancing said, ‘ Blessed be our youth, for that they have
not made our old men ashamed.' *mma :nvem 517³&
mmm, These were the reliyz'ous, and men ofyood works. And
some said, ‘ Blessed be our old men, that have made atonement
for our youth.' And both one and the other said, ‘ Blessed be

he who hath not sinned 5 and he who hath, let it be forgiven
him.5 '²
