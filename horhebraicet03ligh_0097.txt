learn to believe in the Messiah when they should observe
him capable so wondrously to protect his messengers, though
surrounded with such numberless inconveniences of life ε
and might further be taught not to expect a pompous king-
dom when they see the propagators of it, of so mean a de-
gree and quality.

The words of the Baptist U, ὁ ἔχων δύο χιτῶνας, μεταδότω
He that laath two θοαῖς, let him impart, ἄση may be also under-
stood in this sense, that he that hath both the talida and the
chalulc may give to him that is naked and hath neither, either
the one or the other.

Ver. 8 X: ‘'On προφήτης εἷς τῶν ἀρχαίων ἀνέστη· leat one of
tlte 0ch prophets was risen [maim] So is the expression again,
ver. 19; in which sense the ὁ προφήτης, that prophet must be
taken, John i. 21, 25, that is, ὁ προφήτης τις τῶν ἀρχαίων ὃς
ἀνέστη, one of the old prophets that is risen agyam.

Although they looked for no other prophet (excepting
Elias only) before the appearing of the Messiah, yet doth it
seem that they had an opinion that some of the ancient pro-
phets should rise again, and that the time was now at hand
wherein they should so do; and that because they made such
frequent mention of it in their common talk, that “ some one
of the old prophets had risen again.”

Ver. 30: Μωσῆς καὶ Ἠλίας· Moses and Elias] The Jews
have a fiction that Moses shall come with Elias when Elias
himself comes. “ The y holy blessed God said to Moses, ‘As
thou hast given thy life for Israel in this world, so in the ages
to come, when I shall bring Elias the prophet amongst them,
rim-2: ’(ἾΝΞ, mum you two shall come toyether.''

But the rise and foundation of this opinion is very ridi-

culous indeed, having its first ground from Nahum i. 3, ΠᾏΠζ
ἾΞἾἾ magu-’25 Πξὶἢῠξὶ. But Moses, when an infant, was
thrown into ΠΞἸΕ), Eirod. ii. 3. [ῆῆῠξῑ] and Elias went up
into heaven, ΠᾌΞζῖζξὶ 2 Kings ii. [11.] This it is for such as
these to allegorize the Holy Scriptures ἱ

They also feign that Moses was raised up at the same time
with Samuel by the witch of Endor:
