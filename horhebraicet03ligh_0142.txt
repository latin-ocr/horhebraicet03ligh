136 Hebrew and Talmessdz'eal [Ch. xii. 49,

upon St. Paul, when they multiplied their stripeS‚ he himself f
telling us, that five times he had received forty stripes save
one.

But did every one that was adjudged by the court to
stripes, did they always receive that number exactly‚ of
thirty-nine? no doubt the number was more or less, accord-
ing to the nature of the crime. Whieh seems to be hinted
in Pesaokin& 3725& Πρηῖῡ &numm ²⁸³2& He that eatetk the
‘potitlza' [some creeping thing of the sea} “ eet kim be beaten

with four stripes: ΨὮΠ ΠΡἹῖῬ Πῖἳῃῑ He that eateth a pism-z're,

Zet him he beaten willa five.- ww :73:5³7 ,72⁷ssss He that eateth a
hornae, let kim have six? If this be the sense of the words,
then here may arise a question, with what kind of scourge
they were beaten? lf with that scourge of three cords that was
used when they gave nine-and-thirty stripeS, repeating their
strokes by a scourge of three corsis thirteen times, how then
could they inflict four or five stripes wit-h such a scourge as
that was?

But as to the number of stripes which the master might
inflict upon his slave, that was not stated, but left to the
plensure of the master, according to the nature of the crime:
which seems hinted at in these words of our Saviour, and in
the following rule amongst the Jews, some kind of measure
still being attended to:

-meh *2922 7237: 5³:137& anm “It is allowed to deal
with a Oanaanite [that is, a Gentile] slave with, severity. But
though this is dejure, yet there is a law of mercy, and rule of
wisdom, that a man should be gentle, pursuing righteousness,
not making the yoke heavy upon his servant, lest he afflict
him.”

Ver. 49: Καὶ τί θέλω, εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη 3 Ami what will I, zf it
be already leinclled ?] Τι’ θέλω W hat will l, seems to be used
after the manner of the schools, where um& ³2& ’Nn What
do I say? is the same with Ι do says tlnsss: and so ³3& 'Nn
:ffipm ΠἼιαί do I decree or approve? is the same with This I
do decree or approve. So ΠέζἾἾ ³2& 'NYQ τί ἐγὼ θέλω, What

our Saviour, I‘Wzat will I, zf it be already kinclled, the meaning
