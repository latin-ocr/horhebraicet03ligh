ΙΙ. Bread is very frequently used in the Jewish writers
for doctrine. So that when Christ talks of eatinq his flesk, he
might perhaps hint to them that he would seed his followers
not only wit-h his doctrines, but with himser too.

III. There is mention, even amongst the Talmudists

days of Hezekiah they so much partook of the Messiah,
they received him so greedily, embraced him so gladly‚ and
in a manner-,devoured him, that they must look for him
