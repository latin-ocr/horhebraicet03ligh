they say to Christ whiles he was yet standing in the Treasury,
or in the Court of the VVomen, ver. 20. lf you would admit
a Samaritam into the court of the Gentiles, where the Gentiles
themselves were allowed to come, it were much, and is indeed
very questionable3 but who is it would bear such a one
standing in the Treasuryss Which very thing shews how much
this was spoken in raneour and mere malioe, they themselves
not believing‚ nay, perfeetly knowing‚ that he was no Sama-
ritam at that time when they called him so. And it is ob-
servable‚ that our Saviour made no return upon that senseless
reproaoh of theiis, because he did not think it worth the an-
swering: he only replies upon them, “that he hath not a
devi1‚” that is, that he was not mad.

Ver. 57 : Πεντήκοντα ἔτη οὔπω ἔχεις· T flou art ‘not yetfifty
years old] Apply these words to the time of superannuating
the Levites, Numb. iv, and we shall find no need of those
knots and difficulties wherewith some have puzzled them-
selves. Thou art not yetfifcy years old, that is, Thou art not
yet come to the common years of superannuation: and dost
thou talk that “ thou hast seen Abraham 3²²

Ver. 58d: Πρὶν Ἀβραὰμ γενέσθαι, ἐγώ εἶμι· Before Abraham
was, I am] They pervert the question. Christ had said,
‘Abraham saw my dayz’ on the contrary, they ask him,
‘ Hast thou seen Abraham 3'

This phrase, ἐγώ εἶμι, sometimes is rendered from the single
word '⁴23ss I. So the Greek interpreter-s in the Books of
J udges and Ruth: for you seldom or never meet with it else-
where.
