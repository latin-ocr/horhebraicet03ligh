have the same story in Hieros Pealcv, where it were worth
the while to take notice how they vary in the telling it.

Ver. 22: Καὶ ἀπενεχθῆναι αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀγγέλων· ΗΘ was
carried by the cmyela] The Rabbins have an invention that there
are three hands of anqels attend the death of wicked men,
proclaiming, “ There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the
wicked q.’' But what conceptions they have of aozgyels being
present at the death of good men, let us judge from this fol-
lowing passage ε

“ Ther men of Tsippor said, ‘ Whoever tells us that Rabbi
[J udah] is dead, we will kill him) Bar Kaphra, looking upon
them with his head veiled with a hood, said unto them, ‘Holy
men and S angyels took hold of the tables of the covenant‚ and
the hand of the anyels prevailed3 so that they took away the
tables.' They said unto him, ‘ Is Rabbi dead then 3³ '² The
meaning of this parabolizer was this; Holy men would fain
have detained R. J udah still in the land of the living, but the
anyels took him away.

Εἰς τὸν κόλπου τοῦ Ἀβραάμ· Into Abraham's bosowa] So

alter the sense, but strengthens it. The J ewish schools dis-
pose of the souls of Jews under a threefold phrase, 1 can
hardly say under a threefold state :—

I. 3727 322 In the yarden of Edem, or Parad'ise. Amongst
those many instances that might be alleged, even to nau-
seousneSS, let us take one wherein this very Abraham is
named:

“ ‘ Het shall be as a tree planted by the rivers of waters.'
This is Abraham, whom Grod took and planted in the land
of Israe13 or, whom God took and planted ΠΝ ἶλζῑ in Para-
dise.” Take one instance more of one of equal fame and
piety, and that was Moses: “ Whenu our master Moses de-
parted 1737 1:1³3 into Paradz'se, he said unto J oshua‚ ‘ If thou
hast any doubt upon thee about any thing, inquire now of
me concerning it.5 '²
