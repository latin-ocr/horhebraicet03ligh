92 Hebrew and Talmudical - [Oh.ix. 31, 51.

‘⁸ Samuelz thought that day had been the day of judgmcnt,
and therefore he raised Moses along with himself.''

“ Mosesa did not die [for the just die not]; but went up
into the highest, to minister before God.”

Ver. 31: ’Έλεγον τὴν ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ· They spake qf his
decease] The French and Italian translation do render this
word ἔξοδοι) too loosely. The French, Disoyeozt sur l'issue:
the Italian, Dicevano il successo suo. And l wish the English
have not done it too narrowly [nimis stricte]; They spake of
lais decease. It were better, They spake of his departure. For
the ascent of Christ into heaven was his ἔξοδος, as well as his
death: nay, I may say more, if, at least, in the word exodus
there be any allusion to the Israelites' going out of Egypt.
For that was in victory and triumph, as also the ascent of
Christ into heaven was.

There is no question but they did indeed discourse with
him about his death and the manner of it; viz. his cruci-
fixionb: whereas, Moses and Elias themselves did depart
without any pain or anguish. But l should think, however,
there is more contained in that word; and that the expres-
sion ἀναλήψεως αὐτοῦ, the time of lais receivz‘nq up, ver. 51, hath
some reference to ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ, leis departure.

W'e meet with the word ἔξοδος in the Greek version, Prov.
xxx, 12 : “ There is a generation accounteth itself righteous,

They read it wnwwm, when in the original it is imit-sm,
“ And yet is not washed from its filthiness.”

Ver. 51: Ἐυ τῷ συμπληροῦσθαι τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ἀυαλήψεως
αὐτοῦ’ W hen tlte time was come that he should be received up]
It is a difficulty amongst some, why there should be any
mention τῆς ἀναλήψεως, qf leis receiving] up, when there is no
mention of his death. But let it be only granted that under
that expression ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ is included the ascension of
Christ, and then the difficulty is solved. The evangelist
seems from thence to calculate. Moses and Elias had spoken
of his departure out of this world, that is, of his final de-
parture, when he took leave of it at his ascension into
