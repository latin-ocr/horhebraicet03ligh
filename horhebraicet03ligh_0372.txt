The first three days of weeping were severer than the
other: because “ on the first day it was not lawful for the
mourner 1ο wear his phylacterieS‚ to eat of holy things, nor
indeed to eat any thing of his own. All the three days he

“ The first seven days let all the beds in the house be laid

said, ‘ From luz in the backbone? Saith he to him, ‘ Demon-
strate this 10 me.’ Then he took luz, a little bone out of
the backbone, and put it in water, and it was not steeped:
he put it into the fire, and it was not burnt: he brought it 10
