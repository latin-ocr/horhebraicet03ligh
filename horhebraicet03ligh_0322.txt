III. Διὰ τοῦτο, χόν this did Moses give and continue circumci-
sion among you, that you might learn from hence to judge of
the nature of the sabbath day. And let us, therefore, argue
it: If by Moses's institution and allowance it was lawful,
for the advantage of the infant, to circumcise him on the
sabbath day, is it not warrantable, by Moses's law, for the
advantage of a grown man, to heal him on the sabbath day?
If it be lawful to wound an infant by circumcision‚ surely it is
equally, if not much more, lawful to heal a man by a word's
speaking.”

Ver. 27: Χριστὸς ὅταν ἔρχηται, οὐδεὶς γινώσκει πόθεν ἐστίν·
When Christ cometh, no man huon-eth whence ke is] How doth
this agree with ver. 42, and with Matt- ii. 5, 6? They doubted
not, indeed, but he should give the first manifestation of him-

Matt. ii. 1.

Their conceptions in this thing we have explained to us in
Bse‘dras Solen-m .· “ ‘ My beloved is like a roe or a young hart,’
Cant. ii. 9. A roen appears and is hid, appears and is hid
again. So our first redeemer [Moses] appeared and was hid,
and at length appeared again. So our latter Redeemer
[Messiah] shall be revealed to them, and shall be hid again
from them; and how long shall he be hid from them?” &c.
A little afte1·; “In the end of forty-five days he shall be
revealed again, and cause manna to descend amongst them.''
See Bemiclbar Babba, fol. 243. 2.

They⁰ conceive a twofold manifestation of the Messiah; the
first, in Bethlehem3 but will straightway disappear and lie
hid. At length he will shew himself; but from what place
and at what time that will be, no one knew, In his first ap-
