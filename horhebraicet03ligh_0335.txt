‘⁸ Wheng the woman hath drunk the bitter water, if she
be guilty, her looks turn pale, her eyes swell up, &c. So
they turn her out· of the Court of the WVomen ς and first her
belly swells, then her thigh rots, and she dies. The same
honr that she dies, the adulterer also, upon whose account
she drank the water, dies too, wherever he is, being equally
seized with a swelling in his belly, rottenness in his thigh,

You may 866 by these passages how directly our Saviour
levels at the eqnity of this sentence, willingi to bring these
accusers of the woman to a just trial first. You may ima-
gine you hear him thus speaking to them: ‘⁸ Ye have brought
this adulterous woman to be adjudged by me: I will therefore
govern myself according to the rule of tryingk such by the
bitter waters. You say and you believe, according to the
common opinion of your nation, that the woman upon whom
a jealousy is brought, though she be indeed guilty, yet if the
husband that accuseth her be faulty that way himself, she
cannot be affected by those waters, nor contract any hurt or
danger by them. If the divine judgment proceeded in that
method, so will I at this time. Are you that accuse this
woman wholly guiltless in the like kind of sin? Whosoever is
so, ⁴ let him cast the first stone,’ 816. Βι11 if you yourselves
stand chargeable with the same crimes, then your own
applauded tradition, the opinion of your nation, the proce-
dure of divine judgment in the trial of such, may determine in
this case, and aequit me from all blame, if Ι condemn not
this woman, when her accusers themselves are to be 6011-
demned.’'
