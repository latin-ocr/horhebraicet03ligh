Oh. xxi. 22.] Emeroitations upon St. John. 451

kingdom of heaven, Matt. xvi3 that 116 11118111 open the door
of saith and the gospel to the Gentiles, which he did in his
preaching it to Cornelius.

ΙΙ. In sharing out the work of preaching the gospel
6111011881 1116 111166 ministers of the circumcision, his lot fell
amongst 1116 Jews in Babylon. 'James's lot· was 6111011881
1116 Jews in Palestine and Syria: and John’s amongst the
Hellenists in Asia.

ΙΙΙ. Now amongst the Jews in Babylon were mixed 1116
1816611168 of the ten tribes3 and to them did the 8081161 601116
by the ministry of St. Peter, as Ι 116116 shewn more at large
in another treatise.

To this, therefore, have 1116 words of our 861110111- 6 1116111
referenee; namely, putting Peter in mind, that whereas he
had, with so much confidence and assurance of himself, made
'such professions of love and constancy beyond the other dis-
ciples, pretending to a wonderful resolution of laying down
his very life in that behalf, that he would now shew his zeal
and courage in ‘ feeding 1116 sheep’ of Christ :-“ Thou canst
not, Simon, lay down thy life for me, as thou didst 01166
promise 3 for Ι 116ν6 myself laid down my own life, and taken
it up again. ‘ Feed thou my sheep‚’ therefore ; and be ready
to lay down thy life for them, when it shall come to be rc-
quired of thee.'’

So that what is here said does not 80 11111611 point out
Peter’s primacy, as 1118 (1611861; nor 80 11111611 1116 privilege
as the bond of his office, and at last his martyrdom: for
that our Saviour had this meaning with him, 18 1116111, because,
immediately after this, he tells him by what death he should
glorify God, ver. 18.

Ver. 22: Ἐὰν αὐτὸν θέλω μένειν ἕως ἔρχομαι· IfI will that
ke tarry till I coma] Till I come.- that 18, 1111 Ι 601116 10
destroy the city and 11611011 of the Jews. As to 11118 kind of
phrase, take a few instances :—

Our Saviour saith, Matt. xvi. 28, “ There be some standing
here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of
man coming in his kingdom :’' which must not be understood
of his coming to the last judgment; for there was not one
standing there that could live till t-hat time: nor ought it to
be understood of the resurrection, as some would have it; for
