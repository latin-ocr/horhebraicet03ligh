of 25}ae dead, as well the blessed as the miserable. Those who
expound that passage in 1 Pet. iii. 19, of his going down from
the cross into hell to preach to the spirits in prison there, do
very little regard the scope of the apostle, and are absolute
strangers to his meaning in it. For,

1. In that he shuts up the generation before the flood in
an infernal prison, he falls in with the received opinion of
that nation, which was, that that generation had no part in
the world to come; and that they were condemned to boiling
waters in hell.

2. He compares the present generation of the Jews with
that generation before the flood; that Christ did of old
preach even to that generatim, and so he hath done to this;
that that generation perished through its disobedience, ancl
so will this. He runs much upon the same parallel in his
second Episffle, chap. iii. 6, &e We must observe, that the
apostle makes his transition from the crucifixion and resur-
rection of our Saviour directly to the generation before the
flood, passing over all those generations that came between,
on purpose that he might make the comparison betwixt that
and the age he lived in.

ῙῙἾἸΠᾸ ΝἼΠ 'm “ ¹ Mar Zutra saith, that out of tlte limen in
which they wrapped up books, when it yrow old they made
slerouds for the dead of the praelim for this is to their dis· ⁷
yraces' The Gloss adds, “ That they do it of the linen
wherein they sold up the book of the Law.'' Him who had
suffered death by the sentence of the Sanhedfflm, or magis-
trate, they were wont to call ΠἹΒὩ Dm the dead of the pre· ²
cept, because he was executed according to the precept: and
such a one to them was our J esus. Now as to one that was
condemned to death by the magistrate, they had an opinion
that by how much the inore disgracefully they dealt with
him, by so much the greater atonement was made for him.
Hence that expression, Γῖπιζκξηῃ ἾἾΠ &5 “ They did not
openly hewail kim, that that very Setting him at nought” (no
man lamenting him) ‘⁶ might redound to his atonement.''
