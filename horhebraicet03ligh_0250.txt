Ver. 290: ‘O ἀμνὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ· Tlm Lamb of God] St. John
alludes plainly to the lamb of tlte daily sacrifice. Τὸν ἐν τύπῳ
αἴροντα ἁμαρτίαν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, which in shadow took away the sins
οἱ Israel.

I. It was commanded in the law that he that offered the
sacrifice should lay his hand upon the head of the sacrifice,
Levit. i.4; iii. 23 iv. 4, &c

II. The reason of which usage was, that he might, as it

which is more especially evident in the scapegoat, Levit.

and most immediate sense of this is, VVlmre elwellest, or, Where
lodyest thou? But I could willingly render it as if it had been
said, ‘ VVhere dost thou keep thy sabbath 3⁵ and from thence
conjecture that day was the evening of the sabbath. For
whereas it is said, “and they abode with him that day,” it
would be a little hard to understand it of the day that was
now almost gone; and therefore we may suppose it meant of
the following day, for it is added, ὥρα ἢν δεκάτη, it was now the
tenth Ῐιοαν. It was about the middle of our November when
