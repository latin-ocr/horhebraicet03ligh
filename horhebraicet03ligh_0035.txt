116 lived: they called him, therefore, by my name, ‘¹³:¹21 ln]
Nathan of Babylon? ” See also Jerusalem Jevamotla ⁰.

“ Thered was a certain family at Jerusalem that were
wont to die about the eighteenth year of their age: they
made the matter known to R. J ochanan, Ben Zacchai, who
said, ‘Perhaps you are of Eli's lineage, concerning whom it
is said, The increase of thine house shall die in the flower of
their age. Go ye and be diligent in the study of the law, and
ye shall live.q They went and gave diligent heed to the law,
and lived. They called themselves, therefore, lm* mmmm
thefamily qs Jooleanan, after his name.'’

It is disputed in the same tract θ, whether the son begot
by a brother’s raising up seed to his brother should not be
called after the 1161116 of him that is deceased: for instance,
if one (lies without a son, and his name be Joseph‚ or Jo-
chanan, whether the son that is born to this man's brother,
taking his brother's widow to wife, should not have the name
after him that first had her, and be called ‘ J 0361111,ἦ or ⁶ Jo-
chanan.' Otherwise, indeed, it was very seldom that the son
bore the name of the father, as is evident both in the Holy
Scriptures and the Rabbinical writers. It cannot be denied
but that sometimes this was done3 but so very rarely, that
we may easily believe the reason why the friends of Zacharias
would have given the child his own name was merely, either
because they could by no means learn what he himself
designed to call him, or else in honour to him, however he
lay under that divine stroke at present, as to be both deas
and dumb.
