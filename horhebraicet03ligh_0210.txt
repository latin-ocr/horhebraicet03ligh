For this reason he sat at table in the uppermost place next
our Lord : for this reason did our Saviour so often direct his
discourse so immediately to him: and for this reason were
his answers to Christ taken 111 the name of all the r‚est viz.,

would from hence have picked out an argument for the pri-
macy of Thomas or Philip over the rest of the apostles and
the universal church? And yet this do the Romanists in the
behalf of Peter. Who would not have taken it rather as a
severe chiding2 As if hc should have said, “ Thou, Thomas or
