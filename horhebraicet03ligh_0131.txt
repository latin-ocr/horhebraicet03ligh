11. As 'Y‘ULDD τΙιο Disciple and 7¹:7²· the Simulat· are somo-
times confounded, sometimes distinguished, so also is the
scribe and the Pharisee. They are sometimes confounded;
for many of the Pharisees were scribes: and they are some-
times distinguished3 for many of them were of the common
people, and not scribes. Perhaps it may not be improperly
said, that there were Pharisees that were of the clergy, and
Pharisees that were of the laity. He whom we have now
before us was a scribe, but not a Pharisee; but it is not
easy to give the reason why he is termed a Zawycr and not a
scribe. Here is some place for conjecture, but not for de-
monstration. As to conjecture. therefore, let us make a little
essay in this matter.

1. IS conceive that the νομικὸς and νομοδιδάσκαλος, the
lawyer and macher ofthc law, may be opposed to the Saddu-
cees to whom the Pharisee is diametrically opposite ; for
they were contrary to them in their practice of the tra-
ditional rites as much as they could; and these again abun-
dantly contrary to them in traditional doctrines. The Sad-
ducees had, indeed, their scribes or their teachers, as well as
any other party: and there is frequent mention of ”nmo
ΓΡἾἿΞ the scribes of the Sadffaecccs. And from this antithesis,
probably. is Rabban Gamaliel termed νομοδιδάσκαλος, α doctor
cf law. F ort there was then an assembly of the ‘ sect of the
Sadducees‚' ver. 17: and when Gamaliel, who was of the
other sect, made his speech amongst them, it is easy to con-
ceive why he is there termed νομοδιδάσκαλος, α doctor of law.
For the same reason we may suppose the person here before
us might be called νομικὸς, one of the lawyers and not
a scribe, because there were scribes even amongst the Sad-
ducees.

ΙΙ. Ι conceive, therefore, that the νομικοὶ and νομοδιδάσκαλοι
were the traditionary doctors of the law. As to Gamaliel, a
doctor of the law, the thing is without dispute: and if there
were any difference between the lawyers and doctors of the
laW‚ yet as to this matter, I suppose there was none. Let
us consider this following passage: “Itu is a tradition: R.
