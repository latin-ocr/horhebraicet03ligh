Ch. iii. 2 3.] Eva-citatiores upon St. Lake. 53

⁴ What the name of thy father 2' She held her peace. To whom
her foster-father, ‘ Why dost thou not speak 3* ‘ Because,' saith
she, ‘ I know no other father but thee.' 2& θηρὶ &mmmm
'7³³7'mn &5²1 He that educatam the child is called a father, not
ke that beyets itff' Note that : J oseph, having been taught by
the angel, and well satisfied in Mary, whom he had espoused‚
had owned Jesus for his son from his first birth3 he had
redeemed him as his first-born, had cherished him 111 1116
childhood, educated him in his youth : and therefore, 1101
wonder if J oseph be called his father, and he was supposed to
be his son.

ΙΙ. Let us consider what might have been the judgment of
the Sanhedrim in this 6666 only from this story: “ Therea
came a certain woman to Jerusalem with a child, brought
thither upon shoulders. She brought this child upg and he
afterward had the carnal knowledge of her. They are brought
before the Sanhedrim, and the Sanhedrim judged them to be
stoned to death: ἾΝἺἾ UD: *2:³2 &³7 not because lae was zm-

doubtedly her son, rtrum& *15an *2572 &EN but because lm
had wholly adhered to laer.

Now suppose we that the blessed J esus had come to the
Sanhedrim upon the decease of Joseph, requiring his stock
and goods as his heir 3 had he not, in all equity‚ obtained
them as his son? Not that he was, beyond 611 doubt and
question, his son, but that he had adhered to him wholly
from his eradle, was brought up by him as his 6011, 611(1 always
so acknowledged.

III. The doctors spealz of one J oseph 6 carpenterb: ‘mm
*1:1⁶1 “ἼἾΣ1Π omum “ Abnimusc Gardieus asked the Rabbins
of blessed memory, whence the earth was first created:
they answer him, ‘There is no one skilled in these matters;
*marr por· ms ³737& '1¹⁷ &³724 but 90 thou to Josepla
the architect! He went, and found him standing upon the
rafters.’' , -

It is equally obscure, who this Joseph tlte carpentar, and who
this Abnimus was; although, as to this last, he is very fre-
quently mentioned in those authors. They say, thatd “ Abni-
mus and Balaam were two the greatest philosophers in the

ἃ Kiddushin, fol. 80. 1. c Shemoth Rabba, fol. 128. 4.
b Sect. xiii. of the same treatise. ‘¹ Beresh. Rabba, fol. 73. 4.
