CHAP. VI.

VER. 1: Ἐν σαββάτῳ δευτεροπρώτῳ· On tlte second sabbath
after the first] Ι have spoken to this already iu notes upon
Matt. xii : let me add a few things in this place.

It is a controversy amongst the Jewish doctors and the
Baithuseansb‚ about the exposition of those words that con-

cern the offering of the sheaf of the first-fruits; NUUQ‘Z‘
ΠᾎΨζῐ On tlte marrow of the sabbath, Levit. xxiii. 10, 1 1. ⁶

Grlossc ε “ Τ116(1 Baithuseans desired that the first day of
the Passover should be on the sabbath, that the offex-ing of
the sheaf might fall on the first day of 1116 week: and that
the feast of Pentecost might also fall on the first day of the

week. For they interpreted those words0‚ ΠἾ-[Ἱῃζῦ ηῇςᾞ
Πέῐζῗῇ lee priest shall wave the slaeaf on the moroiow Offfi&

sabbath, as if the sense of them were, On the morrow of the
sabbath of the creation.”

Against this the Rabbins dispute with one consent, and in-
deed truly enough‚ affirming, that by the morrow after the
sabbath must be understood the moy-rozo after a sabbatficac
day, or after the first day of the feast. So the Targumist‚
Siphra, Solomon‚ Menahem, 810. So also the Greek version.
We may see their arguments in Siplm'a„ and Pesikta, and
Menacoth„ fol. 65.1. The principal argument is that of
Rabban J ochanan disputing with a Baithusean in the place
last quoted ε “ One scripture (saith he) saith, You shall num-
ber fifty days” (that is, from the day wherein you offer your
sheaf unto Pentecost), Levit. xxiii. 16. “ Another scripture
saith, Ye shall count seven sabbaths, Levit. xxiii. ¹43 Deut.
