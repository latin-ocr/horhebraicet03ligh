judgment amongst them. The author of Juchasin thinks
they may be the words of Adah Bar Ahavah spoken con-
cerning Rabbi J udah. Another Gloss saith, They are spoken
of Adah Bar Ahavah himself. Let us hear them both:
“ Thea day that Rabbi died, Rabh Adah Bar Ahavah said,
by way of prophecy, This day doth he sit in Abraham's bosom.'’
“ Thereb are those indeed that expound, This day doth he
sit in Abraham's bosom, thus3 that is, This day he died.
Which if it be to be understood of Adah Bar Ahavah, the
times do not suit. It seems to be understood therefore, This
day he sits *in Abralaczm's bosom: that is, This day is Adah
Bar Ahavah circumcised, and entered into the covenant of
Abraham.’'

But the reader may plainly see, having read out the whole
period, that these words were spoken neither by Adah nor <gf
him, but by Levi& of whom we have some mention in the
beginning of this passage, and spoken concerning Rabbi
J udah that was now dead. It is Levi also that saith, that
in his room, on that very selfsame day, was Rabh Judah
born in Babylon, according to the common adage of their
school-s, which immediately follows; “ A just man never
dies, till there be born in his room one like him.” So saith

R. Meir; “ When R. Akibah died, Rabbi [Judah] was born:
when Rabbi J udah died, Rabh J udah was born: when Rabh
J udah died, Rabba was born: when Babba died, Rabh Isai
was born.”

We have here, therefore, if we will make up the story out
of both Talmuds, another not very unlike this of ours. In
the ‚Jerusalem Talmud, Rabbi Judah is conveyed by angels;
in the Babylonian, he is placed in Abraham's bosom: neither
would the Glosser have doubted in the least either of the
thing, or of the way of expressing it, so as to have fied to
any new exposition, had he not mistook the person concerning
whom these words were uttered. He supposeth them spoken
of Adah Bar Ahavah (wherein he is deceived) : and because
the times do not fall in right, if they were to be understood of
his death, he therefore frames a new interpretation of his
own, whiles, in the mean time, he acknowledgeth that others
expound it otherwise.
