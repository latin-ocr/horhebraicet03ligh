98 Hebrew and Talmudioal [Oh. x, 2 5.

in St. Matthew, εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν, νομικὸς, one of them which was α
lawyer, is said to be, Mark xii. 28, εἷς τῶν γραμματέων, one of
the scribes.

However there seems some difficulty from a passage in our
evangelist& where Οὐαὶ ὑμῖν, γραμματεῖς, woc moto you scribes,
and Ἀποκριθεὶς δέ τις τῶν νομικῶν, leen answered one of the
lawyers, seems to make some distinction betwixt them. As
to this, we shall make some remarks in its proper place. In
the mean time let it not seem tedicus to the reader‚ if we dis-
course some things concerning the doctors of the law⁷ with
the various classes and orders of them, that we may the better
judge of that sort of men of which we have so frequent men-
tion in the holy Scriptures. And,

I. It is not unknown how the name scribe was a general
title given to all the learned part of that nation, as it is op-
posed to ἾἾΞ the rude and illiterate person. “ If two persons
eat together, ΞἾἾΞἾΒ ΞΠὊΨΨ and are both scribes, they each
of them say grace singly for themselves: nme> ἾΠΝ ³72&
ἾἾΞ ἻΠᾺἾ, but z'f one of them be α scribe, and the other an illi-
terata person, the scribe saith grace, and it sufficeth for the
other that is unlearne(l§'.”

Indeed, the first original of the word ΞἾἾΞἾΕ) did more
peculiarly signify the nmnberers. ΞἺἾΞἹΟΖ ΕἾἿΨΝἾ ἾΝἾΡΞ
“ ΤΙιε απεὶθητε were called Q’QLWD numberers, because they
numbered all the letters of the law: for they said Ἰ (vau) in
35173 (Lev. xi<42) is the middle letter in the whole book of
the laW,” &c. The Gloss gives another reason out of the
Jerusalem Talmud3 namely‚ “ because they numbered all the
points and contents of the lavv, as the forty principal servile
works save one‚’' &c.

Shoulda we indeed grant that the first original of the word
had such narrow bounds as this, yet does not this hinder but
that it afterward enlarged it-self so far as to denote any per-
son learned in the law, and every doctor os it; nay, that it

extended itself even to ΠᾫἹΞἿΠ ἾἺῺῙὯὮ the schoolmasters tlzat
taugylzt children: if not to the very ΓἾΒΞΙῬ libellarii, those
whose business it was to write out bills of divorce and forms
of contu-acts, 820. Of which two there is mention made amongst
