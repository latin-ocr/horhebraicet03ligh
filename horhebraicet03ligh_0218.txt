perisheth. The saith of this thief is admirable3 and kept
even pace with that of the apostles, if, in some circumstances,
it did not go beyond it. The a-postles acknowledged ⁶ J esus

riches of his grace in a singular and extraordinary manner,

upon his observation of that miraculous darkness which at
that time had covered the world.
