VEB. 1: Πέραυ τοῦ χειμάρρου τῶυ Κέδρων” Over the brook
Oeclron] There is a question among expositors about the
article in the plural number τῶν, and the accent in Κέδρωυ;
and that upon this occasion, that it might not be thought as
if any relation were to be had here to Oedars, wherein one
hath been deceived when he thus comments upon it: “It is
called the brook cedron, that is, of Oedars, that grow there.”
So also the Arab. Iozterjp. in this place, ἲἾΝζῬΝ ἻἾΝἾ ἾΞῺ

that the word ἾἼΡ was used in this sense inthe primitive de-
nomination of the brook Κίίῖνοης but rather that the brook
was called so from blackness‚· the waters being blackened by
the mud and dirt that ran into it3 it being, indeed, rather the
sink or common sewer of the city than a brook.

But when the word ἾἼῙ) was used for duay, which it might
be at that time when the Greek version was made, perhaps
those interpreters might translate the Hebrew word into
Greek, which is not unusual with them; so that χειμάρρου
