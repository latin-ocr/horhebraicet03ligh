Oh. xxiv. 50] Evercsimtions *upon St. Lake. 2539

journey. All which may be easily reconciled, if we would
observe that the first space from the city towards this
mount was called Betlzplzaye, which I have cleared elsewhere
from Talmudic authors, the evangelists themselves also con-
firming it. That part of that mount was known by that
name to the length of about a sabbath day's journey, tillh
it came to that part which was called Bethmzys. For there
was Bethany, a tract of the mount, and the town of Bethanys.
The town was distant from the city about fifteen furlongs,
i. e., two miles, or a double sabbath day's journey: but the
first border of this tract (which also bore the name of
Bethany) was distant but one mile, or a single sabbath day's
journey only.

Our Saviour led out his disciples, when he was about to
ascend, to the very first brink of that region or tract of
mount Olivet which was called Beffiany, and was distant from
the city a sabbath day's journey. And so far from the cit-y
itself did that tract extend which was called Bethplmye:
and when he was come to that place where the bounds of
Bethlyhaqe and Bethsmgs met and touched one another, he
there ascended3 in that very place where he got upon the
ass when he rode into Jerusalem, Mark xi. i. thereas,
therefore, Josephus saith that mount Olivet was but five
furlongs from the city, he means the first brink and border
of it: but our evangelist must be understood of the place
where Christ ascended, where the name of olivet began, as
it was distinguished from Bethplzagye.

And since we have so frequent mention of a. sabbath day’s
journey, and it is not very foreign from our present purpose
to observe something concerning it, let me take notice of
these few things:

thousand cubits. ‘² Naomii said to Ruth, ‘ We are com-

manded to observo the sabbaths, and the feasts, &³77 ‘7³72

no man go out of the city beyond two thousand cubits.'’
