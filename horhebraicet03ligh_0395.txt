Ch. xiii. 2.] Exercitations upon St. Jolm. 389

girds himself to wash his disciples' feet: so that while they
are grumbling at the anointing of his head, he does not dis-
dain to wash their feet.

The reason of this extraordinary action of his we may in
some measure spell out from those little prefaces the evange-
list uses before he tells the story.

I. ‘⁶ When J esus knew that his hour was come ἵνα μεταβῇ
ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου, mat he should depart out of this world, &e.''
[There is an expression not unlike this in Bemidbar Rabbaq ‚-
“Abraham said, ‘ I am flesh and blood, ῠῖἳἸὩΠ VD *imm wrm&
μεταβαίνων ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου, to-morrow I shall yo out qs this
world.”']

It had a little rubbed up the memory of his departure out
of this world, that the woman had as it were anointed him for
his funeral: and therefore he riseth immediately from the
table, that he might give them some farewell token of his
humility and eharity, and leave them an example for the
practice of these virtues one amongst another.

ΙΙ. “ The devil having now put into the heart of Judas
to betray him‚'' it was but seasonable for him to shew his
disoiples that he would strengthen and vindicate them against
the wolf who had now stolen, Ι will not say a sheep, but a yoat,
and that out of his own fioek. It must not pass unobserved,
that ‘his disciples' murmured at the lavish use of the ointment‚
Matt. xxvi. 83 as if the murmuring humour was crept in
amongst others also as well as J udas3 which perhaps moved
Christ the more earnestly to meet the beginnings of that dis-
temper by this aetion.

III. “ Knowing that the Father had given all things into
his hands,” ver. 3, he gave the traitor over to Satan, and oon-
firms the rest to himself: signffying, by the external washing,
that his should be seem-ed from the devil by the washing of
Christ. &Vhosoever shall attempt the determination, whether
he washed the feet of J udas or not, let him see how he will
free himself of this dilemma:

If he washed Judas’s feet, why had not he his part in
Christ, as well as the rest of his diseiples? For supposing
that true, “ If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me‚''
