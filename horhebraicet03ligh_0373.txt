Oh. xi. 39, δια] Eaeereitations upon St. John. 367

explication of this passage, then, either all that followed Mary
were women: or if men, they followed her at a very great
distance: or else they had a peculiar dispensation at such
solemn times as these, which they had not in common con-
versation. But the observation indeed is hardly worth a grain
of salt.

Ver. 39: Τεταρταῖος γάρ ἐστι’ For ke bath been dead four
days] The three days of weepingy were now past, and the four
days of Zamentation begun: so that all hope and expectation
of his coming to himself was wholly gone.

[WD'C ’λ [prm ἒς) ΓἾρἸΞ) “They go to the sepulchres‚
and visit the dead for· three days. ΌἾΞ, :num 3*szer ΓΝἸ

wherewith Lazarus was bound hand and foot, and also the
