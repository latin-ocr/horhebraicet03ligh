111011111 of them that speak lies shall be stopped.'' [Ps. lxiii. 12.]
AndZ a little after, upon another subject: “ R. Simeon Ben
Gezirah saith, ΠΝἾῙ) ”RD What 01· how 2=¹eadest thou ,9 If thou
know 1101, Ο thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by
the footsteps of the flock :⁹³ Cant. i. 8.

We will not be very curicus in inquiring whether our
Saviou'r used the very same form of speech, Πθέῆζ) ἾΝὮ, or
Hbffip '12³2 or ΓἹΝἻΡ TN, or any other. In this only he
departs from their common use of speech, 111 that he calls to
another to allege some text of Scripture3 whereas it was
usual in the schools that he that spoke that would allege
some place himself.

Ver. 27: Καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς διανοίας σου· And with all thy
vaituh] Iu this answer of the man there are these two things
observable ε

I. That. our Saviour brings in this clause, which 111 so

many terms is not in Moses ἢ, where the rest are: ΣῘΞᾎῙΤῙῬΞΙΞ
ssl'J‘ND‘LDQZ] Ἡῖζῗξὶξ-ΒΞΞἾ 2 where the Greek both of the
Roman and Alexandrian edition render 'J'TND 3722, ἐξ ὅλης
τῆς δυνάμεώς σου, which is the same with ἰσχύος, with all thy
miylzt. But where is διανοίαςὲ l pass by other copies, wherein
though there is some varying, yet there is not this which is
now before us.

0111· Saviour hath the same clause elsewhere b, but not in
the same order3 Καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς διανοίας σου, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς
ἰσχύος σου, with all thy mind, and with all thy strenqth : here
it is, with all thy εἰν-6119111, and with all tlzges mind. What shall
we say therefore? shall we suppose it writ to this sense in the-
Hebrew in their phylacteries? This we can hardly think.
Was it added by the Greek interpreters, and so the evange-
11818 take it from thence? we see it 18 1101 80. What then?
doth WND signify both ἰσχὺν and ὃιάνοιαυὲ both stram-(yth and
mind ? Here, indeed, the hinge of the question turns, That
it denotes strength, no one doubts 3 yea, and 1116 Rabbins
suppose it denotes Mammon too, with whom the Syriae and
Targumist agree: but still, where doth it signify τὴν διάνοιαν,

the mind ,9
