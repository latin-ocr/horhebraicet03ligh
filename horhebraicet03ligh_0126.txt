1920 Hebrew and Talmudc‘cal [Oh. xi. 39.

speaks of the persons, and not of the vessels; which is plain,
in that,

I. He saith, τὸ δὲ ἔσωθεν ὑμῶν, your inward parts, &e.; so
that the sense is to this purpose : You cleanse yourselves out-
wardly indeed by these kinds of washings3 but that which is
within you is full of rapine.' &e.

II. Whereas he saith, οὐχ ὁ ποιήσας τὸ ἔξωθεν, he ίῖιαέ made
that which is without, he doth not speak it of the artg‘ficer that
made the cup or the plaster, but of God. Else what kind of
argument, is this? ‘ He that made the oups ancl the platters,
made both the outside and the inside of them :⁵ what then?
‘ Therefore do ye make yourselves clean both out-side and
inside too.' But if we refer it to God, then the argument
holds foreibly enough: ⁶ Did not God, that made you without,
make you within too? he expects, therefore, that you should
keep yourselves clean„ not only as to your outside, but as to

your inside too.’
III. It is hardly probable that the Pharisees should wash

the outside of the cup or platter, and not the inside too.
Take but these two passages out of this kind of authors them-
selves: “ThoseC dishes which any person eats out of over
night, they wash them, that he may eat in them d in the
morning. In the morning they wash them, that he may eat
in them at noon. At noon, that he may eat in them at the
mincha. After the mineha‚ he doth not wash them again3

but the cups, and jugs, and bottles, he doth wash, ἾῙὩἹΠἹ

&a Ι will not give myself nor reader the trouble to examine
the meaning of the words: it suffiees that here is mention
only of washing, and that the whole vesseL not of this οι· that
part only: and the washing of such vessels was ΠΞἾΩΨ, by
dz'ppiozy them in water· Θ.

“ Allf vessels ἹἻΠἸ criniri& ἶΠῖἳ ΨἾΒ that have cm outside
and an inside, if the inside be defiled, the outside is also; but
'mn &nrm ΝΚ) ἾΞᾸ &nal zf the outside be clqfi'led, the inside
is not dqftled.'’ One would think this was to our purpose, and
asserted the very literal sense of the words we have in hand,
