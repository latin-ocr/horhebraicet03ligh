they cast out the leprous from &cenef Which must be under-
stood (if we allow of the Rabbins for interpreters) of eities
that had been walled from the days of Joshua. If this city
which the evangelist here mentions were of that number, no
leper would have been suffered in it, unless absolved from his
uncleanness by the priest. For the leprosy remained after
that absolution 3 and the sick man was not healed but restored
to the church. That the man is here said to be πλήρης λέπρας,
full of leprosy; the passage may not impertinently be com-
pared with Lev. xiii. 12, 13.

VVhether he had been purified by the priest before or no,
however, Christ sends him to the priest‚ to offer what was
required from the leper that was clemzsed. The law of Moses
hardly supposeth the leper hfealed when he was made clean.
It i's a question, indeed, whether the disease was ever curable
but by a miraele. And therefore is this man sent to the
Temple to shew himself to the priest, and offer εἰς μαρτύ-
ριον αὐτοῖς, for a testimony anto them, ver. 14: that is, that he
might bear witness, that the leprosy, an incurable disease‚
was now healed by miracle, as formerly it had been in Miriam
and Naaman: and so there was now a great prophet arisen
in Israel.
