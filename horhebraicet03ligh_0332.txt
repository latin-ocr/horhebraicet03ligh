body by way of harmony? The reason of this conjecture is
twofold: partly those Eusebian canons formed into such a
kind of harmony3 partly because, cap.37, he tells us that,
having finished his work, he sent to the emperor τρισσὰ καὶ
τετρασσᾶ, tkrees amlfours : which words if they are not to be
understood of the evangelists, sometimes three, sometimes
four, (the greater number including the less,) embodied toge-
ther by such a harmony, I confess Ι cannot tell what to
make of them.

But be it so that it must not be understood of such a
harmony3 and grant we further that the Latin interpreter
hits him right, when he supposes Eusebius to have picked
out here and there, according to his pleasure and judgment,
some parts of the Holy Scriptures to be transcribed 5 surely
he would never have omitted the evangelists, the noblest and
the most profitable part of the New Testament.

If therefore he ascribed this story of the adulteress to
the trifler Papias, or at least to the Gospel according to the
Hebrews only, without doubt he would never insert it in
copies transcribed by him. Hence possibly might arise the
omission of it in some copies after Eusebius”s times. It is in
copies before his age, viz, in Ammonius, datianus, 810.

Ver. Ι : Ἰησοῦς δὲ ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὸ ὅρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν· Jesus went
anto the mount of Olivea] But whether to the town of Bethany,
or to some booth fixed in that mount, is uncertain. For
because of the infinite multitude that had swarmed together
at those feasts, it is probable many of them had made them-
selves tents about the city, that they might not be too much
straitened within the walls, though they kept within the
bounds still of a sabbath day's journey.

“ ‘ Andx thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy
tentS‚' Dent. xvi. 7. The first night of the feast they were
bound to lodge within the city: after that it was lawful for
them to abide without the walls; but it must be within the
bounds of a sabbath day’s journey. Whereas therefore it is
said, ‘ Thou shalt go unto thy tents3’ this is the meaning of it,
Thou shalt go into thyy tents that are without the walls of
Jerusalem. but by no means into thine own house ²7³
