Asmodeus. For in both places we have this ridiculous tale:
‘⁸ There was a certain woman brought forth a son in the
night-time, and said to her son [a child newly born you must
know], ‘Go and light me a eandle‚ that l may cut thy navelq?
As he was going, the devil Asmodeus meeting him, said to
him, ‘ Go and tell thy mother that if the eock had not erowed
I would have killed thee,5 '⁶ &o

The very name points at- ‘ apostasy‚' not so much that the
devil was an apostate, as than this devil provoked and en-
ticed people to apostatize: Beelzebul amongst the Gentiles, ι
andr Asmodeus amongst the Jews, the first authors of their
apostasy. Whether both the name and demon were not
found out by the Jews to affright the Samaritans, see the
place above quoted ⁸¹: “ When as Noah went to plant a vine—
yard, &finum ΝἻἿὩΣ w: ymb} the demon Asmocleus met him
and said, *13:237 *emm Let me partake with thee,” ὅτε. So that
it seems they suppose Asmodeus had a hand in Noah's
drunkenness. ’te-mm& '27th &ml-W) 35⁸3 ‘⁶ When he [that is,
Solomon] simod, Asmodeus drove him to it‚” &a They call
the ahyel of death by the name ofprinoe os all Satans, because
he destroys all mankind by death, none excepted.
