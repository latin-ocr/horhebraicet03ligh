bridges and bagnios.' R. Jose held his tongue, and said
nothing: but R. Simeon Ben Jochai answered and said,
‘ WVhatsoever they have built, they have built it for their own
advantage. They have built bridges that they might gain a
toll by them.' R. Judah Ben Garis went and told this to the
Roman empire‚ who thus decreed : ⁴ Let R. Judah, who hath
magnified the empire, be promoted: J ose that held his tongue

Izi-m be banislaed to prrus; and for Simeon that reproached it,
let him be killed.'” Simeon hearing these things, betook
himself into a cave; and there lay hid with his son for the
space of thirteen years.

Nowu as to what order or degree amongst the publicans
our Zacchoeus held, it is neither easy nor tanti to determine
it.. The title of ἀρχιτελώνης, chief among] the publicans, will
hardly bear it, that he was one of those that received toll or
custom at bridges3 though even amongst those there were
some who had the title of tlte φθαῖεν publicans. He may
rather be esteemcd either of the fi‘rst or the second class of
those I have already named. In either of those it was easier
for him συκοφαντεῖν, to mise false accusation ayainst any (which
he chargeth himself with) than at the bridge or so.

amongst the poor of these goods that had been ill got was
necessary. In Sankea'rimx there is a discourse of restitu-
tion, and distribution of dishonest gains, especiallyy what
wealth had been got by merchandise of fruits of the seventh
year, which are forbidden. And this is the form of restitu-
tion: “ Ι, N„ the son of N„ scraped up such a sum by the
fruits of the seventh year3 and behold, I bestow it all upon
the poor.’'

II. Alius were to be given to the poor out of wealth ho—
nestly acquired: but according to the rules and precepts of
the Rabbins, they were not bound to bestow above one fifth
part. “ Asz to what help is to be affor-ded by mammon, there

is a stated measure3 ῚΞἹΌὩ riwin& ΝἾΠἹ viz· aflftk Part Of
his mammon. No one is bound to give more than one fifth.”

And they say, “That it is decreed in Usha, that a man
