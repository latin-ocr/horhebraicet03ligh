Ch. ix. 2.] [ulcere-filatim& upon St. John. 539

“·’ There is a repository (saith R. Solonion), the name os
which is Goph .· and from the creation. all the souls that ever
were to be born were formed together and there placed.''

But there is another R-abbin brought in by another coni-
mentator‚ that supposeth a twofold Goplz, and that the souls
of the Israelites and of the Gentiles are not in one and the
same Goph. Nay further, he conceives that in the days of
the Messiah there will be a third Goph, and a new race of
souls made.

R. Jose deduceth his opinion from Isa. lvii. 16, *geba [m

ῆῆῒῶξζῖ miserably wresting the words of the prophet to this
sense, “ My will shall hinder for the souls which Ι have mades*
For so Aruch and the commentatore explain his mind.

Grant now that what I have quoted might be sufficient
confirmation that the Jews did entertain the opinion of the
soul’s preexistence‚ yet what concern the preexistence of souls
hath with this place, I confess Ι have not so quick an appre-
hension as any way to imagine, unless we will suppose a
μετεμψύχωσις too3 or that some souls come immediately from
the hand of God stained and defiled.

ΙΙΙ. Ι would therefore seek to untie this knot some other way.

Ι. Ι would have that passage observed which we have in
Vajicra Rabbam .· “ And the days draw nigh, in the which thou
shalt say, I have no pleasure in them‚'' Eccl, xii. 1. *22* ¹¹ ²55³&

of tlte Messiah, wherein there shall be neither merit ozor demerit ;”
that is, if I mistake not, wherein neither the good deserts of
the parents shall be imputed to the children for their advan-
tage„ nor their deserts for their fault and punishment. They
are the words of R. Akibah in locum, and they are his appli-
cation of that passage in Eccles.‚ and indeed his own invention ;
but the opinion itself‚ that there shall be neither merit nor
demerit in the days qf the Messialz, is what is commonly re-
ceived amongst the Jews. If so, then let me a little enlarge
this question of our Saviour’s disciples, by way of paraphrase‚
to this purpose: “ Master, we know that thou art the Mes-
siah, and that these are the days of the Messiah3 we have
also learned from our schools, that there is no imputation of
