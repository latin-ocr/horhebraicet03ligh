women of quality in Jerusalem were wont to bring] them this cup
of their own accord. And no doubt there were women in
Jerusalem enough that would not be wanting in this good
office towards Jesus: but he, saith St. Mark, would not re-
ceive it. After this, it is probable, the soldiers‚ or some of
the Jews, might, in scorn and derision, offer him a draught of
vinegar and gall, of which he also refused to drink. But be
it so, that there was but one cup given him, and that of vine-
gar mingled with gall, yet we have observed‚ in our notes
upon Matt. xxvii. 34, how easily these two evangelists may be
reconciled.

II. As to those that were condemned by the Sanhedrim,
there was no need that they should have any other drink
than the intoxicating wine; for they were quickly dead, and
felt no thirst. But the cross kept the wretch a long time
in exquisite torment, and those torments provoked a mighty
thirst. So that perhaps there might be a vesseL full either
of water 01· something else that was drinkable‚ placed near
the cross, by which he that was crucified might allay his
thirst, as need should require. Whether this vinegar might
be according to the custom of the Romans, or whether only
offered at this time in sport and mockery‚ I will make no
inquiry at present. Christ knew beforehand that vinegar
would be given him when he should say, ‘⁶ I thirst;” and
therefore did he on purpose say, “I thirst,'' that vinegar
might be given him, and the prophecy fulfilled.
