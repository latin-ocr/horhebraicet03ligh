to know his transgression, he was confined within four cubit-s,
so that he must not stir beyond them till the sabbath was
done and over.'’

They further instance in another foundation for the two
thousand cubits : “ ‘Ye Ρ shall measure from without the city
on the east side two thousand cubitsj' Num'b. xxxv. 5. But
another Scripture saith, ‘ From the wall of the city and out-
ward ye shall measure a thousand cubits [ver. 4] : the thou-
sand cubits are the suburbs of the city, and the two thou-
sand cubits are the sabbatical limits.” Maimonidesq very
largely discourseth in what manner and by what lines they
measured these two thousand cubits from each city: but· it
makes very little to our purpose. Only let me add this one
thing3 that if any one was overtaken in his journeying in
the fields or wilderness by the night, when the sabbath was
coming in, and did not exactly know the space of two thou-
sand cubits, then he might walk ΠἾὉὊἾΞ ΓὶἸῃἾῠΞ ΞἾἾΞΒΝ
two thousand ordinary paces.- and these were accounted the
nam :nrm ἸΤἸ the sabbatical bozmds ¹.'’

So far from the city was that place of mount Olivet, where
Christ ascended 3 viZ„ that part of the mount where Beth-
pkaye ended and Bethany began. Perhaps the very same
place mentioned 2 Sam. xv. 323 or certainly not far off,
where David in his ssight taking leave of the ark and sanc-
tuary, looked back and worshipped God. VVhere if any one
would be at the pains to inquire why the Greek interpreters
retain the word Ῥὼς, Ros, both here and in chap. xvi. 1 ; Καὶ
ἣν Δαβὶδ ἐρχόμενος ἕως τοῦ Ῥὼς, and David came anto Ros,-
and Δαβὶδ παρῆλθε βραχύ τι ἀπὸ τῆς Ῥώς, and David passed
on α little way from Ros‚· he will find a knot not easy to be
untied. The Talmudists would have it a place of idoLatry,
but by a reason very far-fetched indeedS. The J ewish com-
mentatore, with a little more probability, conceive that it was
a place from whence David, when he went towards Jerusalem,

looking towards the place where the tabernacle was seated,
was wont to worship God.
