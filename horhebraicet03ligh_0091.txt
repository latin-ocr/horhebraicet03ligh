“ Shez who transgresseth the law of Moses, and the J ewish
law.” The Gloss is, “The Jewish law, that is, what the
daughters of Israel follow, though it be not written.'’

“Who is she that transgresseth the law of Moses ’ἓ She
that gives her husband to eat of what is not yet tithed : she
that suffers his embraces while her menstrua are upon her:
she that doth not set apart a loaf of bread for herself: she
that voweth and doth not perform her vow.''

“ How doth she transgress the Jewish law? lf she appears
abroad with her head uncovered: if she spin in the streets:
if she talk with every one she meets. Abba Saul saith, If
she curse her children. R. Tarphon saith, If she be loud and
clamorous.'’ The Gloss is, “If she desire coition with her

hear her.”

Maimonides upon the place: “If when she is spinning in
the street, she makes her arms 80 naked that men may see

any such thing either at her eyes or cheeks: if 8116 play with
young men: if she curse her husband’s father 111 the presence
of her husband,” &c

’ what the word ζΤ-ΝᾎΠ simzers signifies in the Old Testament,

and what ἁμαρτωλοὶ, sinnas, in the New.

Ver 38 : f< αὶ στᾶσα παρὰ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ ὀπίσω· And stood
at his feet behind kim] She washed his feet as they lay
stretched out behind him: of which posture we treat more
largely in our notes upon John xii.

Ver. 47: ’Ότι ἠγάπησε πολύ· For she loved much] If we
consider these two or three things, we shall quickly understand
the force and design of the word ὅτι, fhr, 816.

Ι. That this was not the first time when this woman be-
took herself to our Saviour3 nor is this the first of her re-
ceiving remission of her sins. It is supposed, and that. not
without good reason, that this was Mary Magdalene. If so,
then had her ‘ seven devils' been cast out of her before; and
