168 Hebrew and Talmudical [Ch. xvi. 22.

sent by God to take away the soul of Moses ; which when he
could not do, “ God taket-h hold of him himself, ΠΠΠ ΠΠᾹἾ
ἻἹΠΞΠ ΝΕΞ and treasuretlc him up under tlte throne of fiores*
And a little after; “Nor is Moses’s soul only placed under
the throne of ylory ,· but the souls os other just persons also
are reposited under the throne ofyloryf'

Moses, in the words quoted before, is in Paradise3 in these
words, he is under the throne qf ylory. In another place y,
“ he is in heaven ministering before God.” So that under
different phrases is the same thing expressed 5 and this, how-
ever, is made evident, that there Γῖζ) ῑλ the qarden of Edem
was not to be understood of an earthly‚ but a heavenly para-
dise. That in Rev. vi. 9, of ‘ souls crying under the altar‚'
comes pretty near this phrase, of being placed under the
throne of ylory. For the Jews conceived of the altar as the
throne of the Divine Majesty; and for that reason the court
of the Sanhedrim was placed so near the altar, that they
might be filled with the reverence of the Divine Majesty so
near them, while they were giving judgment. Only, whereas
there is mention of the souls of the martyrs that had poured
out their blood for God, it is an allusion to the blood of the
sacrifices that were went to be poured out at the foot of the
altar.

would know what it is, you need seck no further than the
RhemistS, our countrymen (with grief be it spoken), if you
will believe them; for they upon this place have this passage:
“The bosom of Abraham is the restingplace of all them that
died in perfect state os grace before Ohrist’s time3 heaven,
before, being shut from men. It is called in Zachary a lake
without water, and sometimes a prison, but most commonly
of the divines Limbus patrum; for that it is thought to have
been the kiyker part or brim of hell,'' 2310.

lf our Saviour had been the first author of this phrase,
then might it have been tolerable to have looked sor the
meaning of it amongst Christian expositors; but seeing it
is a scheme of speech so familiar amongst the Jews, and our
Saviour spoke no other than in the known and vulgar dialect
