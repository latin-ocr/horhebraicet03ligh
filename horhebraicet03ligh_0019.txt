viz. one born of the lineage of priests. It was lawfult for a
priest to marry a Levitess, or indeed a daughter of Israel:
but it was most commendable of all to marry one of the
priests' line, Hence that story in Taanitlc (ubi supr.)‚ “ F our-
score pair of brethren-priests took to wife fourscore pair of
sister-priestesses in Gophna all in one night.”

There was hardly any thing among the Jews with greater
care and caution looked after than the marrying of their
priests3 viz, that the wives they took should not by any
means stain and defile their priestly blood: and that all
things which were fit for their eating should be hallowed.
Hence that usual phrase for an excellent woman, ,ΠἎἈἾΠ
'nm-1:³7 &mm-537 She deserves to marry with, α priest.

Josephusu speaks much of this care, ὅπως τὸ γένος τῶν
ἱερέων ἄμικτον καὶ καθαρὸν διαμένη, that the whole priestly
qeneration miylct be preserved pure and unblemled.

Ver. 6 : Ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἐντολαῖς καὶ δικαιώμασι, Sto] In all
the commandmeozts and ordinatrices, &⁶.] So Numb. xxxvi. 13,
Αῧται αἱ ἐντολαὶ καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα, These are the commandments
ancl judyments. It would perhaps seem a little too fine and
curicus to restrain the ἐυτολαὶ to the decaloyue, or teu com-
manffnents, and the δικαιώματα to the ceremonial and judicial
laws, though this does not wholly want foundation. It is
certain the precepts delivered after the decalogue, from
Exod. xxi to chap. xxiv, are called δικαιώματα, y'udywwnts‚ or
ordinamae, Exod. xxi. 1 ; xxiv. 3.

The Vulgar can hardly give any good account why he
should render δικαιώματα by y'ustzflcations, much less the fol-
lowers of that translation why they should from thence fetch
an argument for justification upon observation of the com-
mands, when the oommawds and institutions of men are by
foreign authors called ὃικαιώματα; nay, the corrupt customs
that had been wickedly taken up have the same word, 1 Sam.
