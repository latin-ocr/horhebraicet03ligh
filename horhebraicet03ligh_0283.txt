neither. This is to be understood, if the Samaritan should
knead it in the house of an Israelite.⁷' Now if the Samaritam
may knead dough in an Israelite's house, it is evident the
Israelite might use the Samaritan.

“Ank Israelite may circumcise a Cuthite; but a Outhite
may not circumcise an Israelite, because he is circumcised
into the name of mount Gerizim. lt. Josah saith, Let him
circumcise him, and let him pass into the name of mount
Gerizim till he departs this life.'’ If therefore it was lawful
for the Israelite to circumcise the Guthite οι· Samaritam, and
the Samaritan the Israelite, then thre ‚Jews had derclingys mma,
or did use, tlw Samaritanus.

What then must be the proper meaning of συγχρῶνταιζ
the Hebrew word ΓρΞΠῦὩῙ seems to answer it: “The Outh-
ites of Caesarea asked R.Abhu, saying‚ Your fathers ΓΠΞΓἾΞΧ)
συινεχρῶυτο σαφ’]ἱιΐίιενεε why then do not you the same to us?”
Let us gather the sense from something like it. lt was a
trite and common saying among the Jews, mm ‘'3sz 32³?

fitable to the Jews. And in this sense I would understand the
words now in hand : '⁸‘ The Jews have no such dealings with
the Samaritans as to be obliged to them for any courtesy or
benefit received from them: they ask or receive nothing from
them gratis; they borrow nothing of them, which is not for-
bidden them as to any other nations.'’

“ Form three days before the feasts of the idolaters, it is
forbidden [the Jews] either to given to or receive from them,
to ask, or lend, or borrow of them :’' but for any other parts
of the year it was not forbidden them. But as to the Sama-
ritaris, it was not permitted the Jews to borrow or receive
any thing from them at any time gratis. Nor, indeed, can
the word συγχρῶνται, in this place, intend any thing else.
For whereas it was lawful for the Jews to converse with the
Samaritans, buy of them, use their labour‚ answer to their
benedictions‚ ‘ Amen‚' as we find in Beracotlw, lodge in their
