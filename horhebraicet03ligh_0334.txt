him by those words, “ He that is without sin among you,''
δῖα, yet did he stoop down again, and write upon the earth.

Many have offered their conjectures why he used this

H. Among the Jews, this obtained in the trial of a wife
suspected: “ Iff any man shall unlawfully lie with another
woman, the bitter water shall not try his wife ε for it is said,
