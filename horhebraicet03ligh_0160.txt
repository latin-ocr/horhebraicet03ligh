154« Hebrew and Talmztdiectl [Oh. xv. 7.

Let him tell, if he ean, what kind of just person that should be
that is not mild or humble. But to return to our business.

[Is They divide the just into ΟᾪἾἾΞ those that are Just
and no more [justos tantum} and ΕἾἾἸὮἎ ΕΞἺῚἿἾΒ those that
are perfbctlyjust. Under the first rank they place those that
were not always upright3 but having lived a wieked and irre-
ligious life, have at length betaken themselves to repentanee
and reformat-ion. These they eall ΠἎἾἙΠΠ *³792 penitents.
Under the latter rank are they placed who have been al-
ways upright and never deolined from the right way: these
they eall minim ΞἾΡἿἼΞ perfectlyjust, and δὶἾΡἾΞΠΞ ΞῬἾἻΕ
just from their first oriyt‘nal: as alsQ :imvm ”mim &mori
ltoly or qood men, and men ofyood works. Such a one did he
account himself, and probably was so esteemed by others that
saith, ι· Ally these have Ι kept from my youth.'' And such a
one might ΝῬΟΠ &Vh-T that ltoly man be thought, Νι) ww&
ἾἾῩΞἾἾ 172 r‘mn '1237 wlto never committed one tres-pass alt the
days ofltz's life .· exeeptiug this one misfortune that befel him,
ἼἾ ‘7127 ΓζῖἛΠῖἳ mm ‘tw ῙἾῙΤΞΠ ΒἿᾞἹΓΠῩ] ίΙιαίΖ once lte put
on tlte phylacteries for his foresteacl befhre the phylacterz'es for his
arms. A wondrous fault indeed! And what pity is it that
for this one trespass of his life he should lose the title of
ἾὫΞᾺ ἾὍΠ one perfectly koly. Yet for this dreadful crime
is the poor wretch deprived of a solemn interment‚ and by
this was his atonement made.

We meet with this distinction of just persons in Barac-oth .-
“ R. Abhua saith, In the place where stand ΠΠἹΨῙἾ Ἶῖᾋῃ
tlte penitents‚ there do not stand minim ΞὛΡἾἾΞ the perfectly
just.'' This distinction also appeared both in the tongues
and persons of those that were daneing in the Temple at the
feast of Tabernaoles. “ Someb of them said, ⁶ Blessed be our
youth that have not made our old men asha1ned.' ἾῘῬΝ
ΠΨΝὮ *imm :ivon T laese were tlte lzoly and men ofqood
works. Others said, ‘Blessed be our old men who have ex-
piated for our youth? rmum *³792 557³& These were they
who became penz'tents.''
