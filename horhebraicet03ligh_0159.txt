Ver. 4: Ἐννενηκονταεννέα· Nz‘nety-and—ozine] This was a
very familiar way of numbering and dividing amongst the
Jews, viz. betwixt one and ozz‘nety. I have given instances
elsewhere‘, let me in this place add one more: “Ofu those
hundred cries that a woman in travail tittei‘eth, m'nety-aml-
nine of them are to death, and only one of them to lifes*

Ver. 7 : Οἵ τινες οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσι μετανοίας· Which med no
repentance] Here we are to consider the distinction com-
monly used in the J ewish schools 2-

Ῑ. All the good, and those that were to be saved at last,
they called ΞᾞἾἾΕ just persons. [It is opposed to the word
ΕἾῃζζῚἾ wicloed persons, as we may observe more than once in
the first Psahn] Hence this and the like passage very fre-
quently, ΞῬἾἻΕἷῖ l-ly 12 Paradise is for the just.- numi

Let us by the way play a little with the Gemarists‚ as
they themselves also play with the letters of the alphabet,
and amongst the rest especially the letter Β [Tsadij ἾἻΞζ
ΠΞΟἾΨὩΧ ἾἻΞἿ mmm there is Tsaclz' that beqins a word, [Tsadi
non finalis] [or tlte crookeol XL (md Tsadz' that ends a word
(or the strevi-9723 γ). W hat follows from hence? ῆἾΞΞ ,ὫἾἼΞ
rmum fvi-m There is tloejust person that is croolved [or bowed
down]‚ and there is the just person that is ercet or straiylat.
VVhere the Gloss hath it, “ It is necessary that the man that
is right and straight should be bowed or humble, and he shall
be erect in the world to come.” Arndt, acknowledgeth the
same Gloss3 but hc also brings another which seems of his
own nlaking3 That “ there is a just person who is 5³23? mim
or lmmble ;·but there is also a just person who is not so.''
