occurred in the Prophets, so long as those expressions in the
Prophets may be turnedl to some other sense, either historical
or allegorical. But if they had apprehended any thing plain
and express in the books of Moses, the Prophets also asserting
and illustrating the same thing, I cannot see why we should not
believe they were received by them.

Something of this kind is the passage now in hand, where
we find the Samaritan woman using the word Alsessias ,· which
though it is not to be met with in the books of Moses, yet
Moses having clearly spoken of his coming, whom the Pro-
phets afterward signalized by the name of the Messinm this
foundation being laid, the Sadducees and the Samaritans do
not stick to speak of him in the same manner, and under the
same title, wherein the Prophets had mentioned him. But
then what kind of conceptions they had of the person,
kingdom, and (lays of the Messiah, whether they expected
the forerunner Elias, or the resurrection of the dead at his
coming, as the scribes and Pharisees did, is scarcely credible.
