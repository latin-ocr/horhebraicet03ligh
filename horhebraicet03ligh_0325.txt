Greeks, even purer than that in J udea itselfS.“' VVhence for
a Palestine Jew to go to the Babylonish dispersim, was to
go to a people and country equal, ift not superior, to his
own: but to go to the dispersion among tlte &mel-s, was to
go into unclean regions, where the very dust of the land de-
filed them: it was to go to an inferior race of Jews, and
more impure in their-blood; it was to go into nations most
heathenized [etlmz'ce'ssz'mas].

Ver. 37 : ’Ev δὲ τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ μεγάλῃ τῆς ἑορτῆς’ In
tlte last clay, tlzat 9¹2·th daps of thefeast] The evangelist speaks
according 'to a received opinion of that people: sor from di-
vine institution it does not appear that the last (lay of the
feast had any greater mark set upon it than the first U: nay,
it might seem of lower consideration than all the rest. F or
on the first day were offered thirteen young bullocks upon the
altar3 on the second, twelve; and so fewer and fewer, till
on the seventh day it came to seven ; and on this eighth
and last days of the feast there was but one only. As also
for the whole seven days there were offered each day fourteen
lambs, but on this eighth day seven only, Numb. xxix. So
that if the numbers of the sacrifices add any thing to the
dignity of the day, this ἐσχάτη, last day, will seem the most in-
considerable, and not the μεγάλη, the 512·th day of the feast.

this day, we may learn from themselves :

The Gloss is, “ I have no advantage or refreshment in that
great feast with them, but in this little one with thee.''
