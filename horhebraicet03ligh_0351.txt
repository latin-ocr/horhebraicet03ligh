communicati0n3 among all the four-and-twenty reasons of
excommunication‚ which should it be for which this was de-
919911, viz, that “if any man did confess that J esus was the
Christ, he should be put out of the 3)119808119ῗ” The elders of
the Sanhedrim, perhaps, would answer, what upon other oc-
casions is frequently said and done by them, “ It is decreed
'‘D’‘ ἾἾἾΞῘὈ for the necessity of the time.”

Ver. 28: “Ημεῖς τοῦ Μωσέως ἐσμὲν μαθηταί” We are Mose-3⁹
disciples] The man, as it should seem, had in gentle and per-
suasive terms asked them, ‘⁴ Will ye also be his disciples 32’
as if he heartily wished they would. But they as ruggedly,
‘⁵ Be you so: we are M ose-3⁹ disozfflesss’

“Theyc delivered two disciples of the wise men into the
hands of the chief priest'’ [that they might instruct him about
the rites and 1139893 of the day of expiation]; 3³7³?237DD
07le ‘7127 they were ⁰f the disciples qf Moses. And who are
these diseiples qf Moses? it follows, ΓΡῚἺΒ imos& the very

The reader may observe, by 1119 way, these clzfsciples qs
Moses' disciples‚ with what reverence they treat him.

“ Mosesd was angry about three things, and the tradition
was accordingly hid from him: Ι. About the sabbath, Exod.
xvi. 20: while he was 91181) 119 forgot to recite to them the
traditions about the sabbath. ΙΙ. Α110111 1119 vessels of metal,
Numb. xxxi. 14: while he was 91181), 119 forgot to recite to
them the traditions about the vessels of metal. ΙΙΙ. About
the mourner, Lev. x. 16: while 119 was wrath‚ the tradition
was hid from him, which forbade the mourner to eat of the
holy 11111183.”

Did Moses think it unlawful for the mourner to have caten
of the holy things, when he spake to Eleazar and Ithamar,
while they were in the very 991 of bewailing the death of
their two brethren‚ “Wherefore have ye not 991911 1119 3111
offering in the holy place 3'' Yes, but in his passion he forgot
both the tradition and himself too. Excellent disciples indeed !
that can thus chastise your great master at pleasure‚ as a man
very hasty, apt to be angry, and of a slender memory! Let
him henceforward learn from you to temperate his passions
and quicken his memory. You have a memory indeed that*
have recovered the tradition which lie himself had fol-got.
