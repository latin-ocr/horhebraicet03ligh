‘Tun and that iS, bricks, halfbrioks, squarecl hewn stanes, and rougylz
or unbem. Now, therefore, when there were so many apart-
ments about the courts, were those all paved with rough stone
or bricks, and this only of square and hewn stone? VVithout
doubt the whole building was much more uniform. And then
we shall hardly find out any more probable reason why this
place was particularly and above all other rooms called Gazitlc,
but that it was laid with a more noble and rich pavement
than all the rest. And, therefore, what should forbid that
Λιθόστρωτον, tlce Pavement, should not in this place be meant of
the room Gazith ,9

Obj. But Gazitlz was in the holy place; and it was not
lawful for Pilate, being a Gentile, to enter there.

Sol. I. If he would do it ‘per fas et nefas’ [si per vim vel-
let} who could hinder him?

II. It is a question whether he could not sit in that room,
and yet be within the bounds of the Court of the Gentiles,
into which it was lawful for a Gentile to enter. Half of that
room, indeed, was within the court of Israe13 but there the
fathers of the council themselves did not sit, because it was
lawful for none to sit in that court but the king only. The
other half part in which they sat was in Olwl, and extended
itself, as it should seem, into the Oourt of the Gentiles, For
if ¹71⁸! [Chel] was but ten cubits’ breadth within the wallsb, it
would be much too narrow a room for seventy men to sit in,
if the Gazith. did not extend itself a little within the Gourt
of the Gentiles.

Ἐβραϊστὶ δὲ Γαββαθᾶ· Bate ia the Hebrew, Gabbatlaa] The
Syriae renders it by ΝΠΞἛἎ [περίβολος] a momad or seme.-
which may fall in with what we have said: for ‘737 ohel, in
which was part of this room, was the fence to [περίβολος,
ambiens] all the courts, excepting the Oonrt of the Gentiles.

But let us see whether Γαββαθᾶ is Hebrew for Λιθόστρωτον
or no. Tha't :12 aab, amongst other things, signifies a sur-
face‚ doth not stand in need of much proof ε and so the pave-
ment and suoface of the floor are convertible. And as that
room might be pec-uliarly called Gazitk in the ancient J ewish
language‚ upon the account of its pavement‚· so might it in
their more modern language be called &22 or ΝΠΞᾸ, for
