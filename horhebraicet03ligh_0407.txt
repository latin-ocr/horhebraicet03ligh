II. The minds of the disciples at present were greatly dis—
tressed and troubled, so that the promise of a Oowfforter seems
more suit-able than that of an Advocato, to their present state
and circumstances,

Ver. 17 : Τὸ Πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας· Tlae §spirit osirath] Let
us but observe how the whole world at- this time lay in false—
hood and error: the Gentiles under a spirit of delusion; the
Jews under the cheat and imposture of traditions: and then
the reason of this title os the Spirit qftrutlc will appear3 as
also how seasonable and necessary a thing it was that such a
Spirit should be sent into the world.

Ver. 26: Ὓμᾶς διδάξει πάντα· He shall {each you all temys]
So chap. xvi. 13 : ‘⁶ He shall lead you into all truth.'' Here it

Gentiles.

Ver. 31⁵³: Ἐγείρεσθε, ἄγωμεν ἐντεῦθεν· Ari-se, let us 90 hence]
These words plainly set out the time and place wherein our
vSaviour had the discourse which is contained in this four-
teenth chapter. The place was Bethany ; the time, the very
day of the Passover, when they were now about to walk to
Jerusalem.

Those things which Christ had discoursed in chap. xiii were
said two nights before the Passover3 and that at Bethany,
where Christ supped at the house of ‘ Simon the leper.’ He
abode there the day following, and the night after3 and now,
when the feast day was come, and it was time for them to be
