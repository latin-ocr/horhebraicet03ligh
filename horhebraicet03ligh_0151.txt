Ch. xiii. 35] Effer-eimtv'ons upon NJ. Lustra. 145

might therefore think, that the words have some respect to
this very time and acti0n3 but that 111 St. Matthew these
words are repeated by our Saviour after this triumph was
over<l.

Christ is now at Jerusalem, at the feast of Dedication ς at
least that feast was not far off 3 for we find him going to it,
ver. 22: so that this exposition of the words looks fair
enough ς “ Ye see me now, but henceforward ye shall see me
no more, until ye shall say, ‘Blessed is 110 that cometh in
the name of the Lord1';⁷ ’' which very thing was said in that
triumph of hisS. But what shall we say then to that of
St. Matthew, that these very words are recited sometime
after 110 had received these acclamations from the people‘?
I would hardly believe with the learned Heinsius, that the
words in St. Matthew are not set in their proper place, but
the series of the history is transposed : I would vrather think
our Saviour meant not· an ocular seeing him, but spolie it. in
a spiritual and borrowed 50115ος viz. in the sense wherein
the Jews were wont to use the word seeingy, when they spake
of “ seeing the Messiah‚ the days of the Messiah‚ and the
consolation of Israel 3⁵⁹ that 15, of partaking and enjoying the
comforts and advantages os the Messiah‚ and of those days
of his. So that our Saviour”s meaning may seem to be this ;
“ Ye shall, from henceforward, enjoy no benefit from 1110 the
Messiah‚ till ye shall say, ’- Blessed is he that cometh,’ '³ &c.:
for it is worthy our inquiry, whether Christ ever after these
words of his, did endeavour so to gather the children of J eru—
salem together, that the city might not be destroyed, and the
whole nation cast off. He did indeed endeavour to gather τὸ
λεῖμμα κατ’ ἐκλογὴν χάριτος, the remoavit accordiny to the election
of yrace, [Rom. xi. 5 ς] but did he ever after this 111110111-
that the place and nation might be preserved? As to these,
it is argument enough that he had given them wholly over in

Α his own mind, in that here, and in St. Matthew, he did in

such precise terms denounce the ruin of Jerusalem, imme-²
diately before he uttered these words. I had rather, there-
fore, than admit any immethodicalness in St.Matthew‚ ex-
pound the passage to this sense; “ From henceforward ye
