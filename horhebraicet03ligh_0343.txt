(th. ix. 2.] Emercc'tations upon St. John. :537

Ἐγώ εἰμι καὶ αἱ συνεταιρίδες μου· Latin, Ερο ipsa, et sodales
meoe.

Rutheiv.4; ³723an ⁵:223, Ι will redeam it. Greek, Ἐγώ
εἶμι ἀγχιστεύσω. Latin, Eyo swa„ redimam.

As to this form of speech, let those that are better skilled
in the Greek tongue be the judges. Our Saviour's expression
seemeth something more difficult, because he doth not say
Πρὶν Ἀβραὰμ γενέσθαι, ἐγὼ ἦν, but Ἐγώ εἰμι; to this purpose,
as it would seem, Before Abraham was, I am.

W ould you also murder another prophet in the very court of
the Temple, Ο ye murderous generation'? Remember but
Zacharias, and surely that might suffice. But whence could
they get stones in the court of the Temple? Let the answer
be made from something parallel:

“ Itf is storied of Abba Chalpatha, who, going to Rabban
Gamaliel at Tiberias, found him sitting at the table of Jo-
chanan the moneychanger, with the Book of J ob in his hand
Targumized [that is, rendered into the Ghaldee tongue], and
reading in it. Saith he to him, ⁶ I remember your grandfather
Rabban Gamaliel, how he stood upon Grab in the mountain
of the Temple, and they brought unto him the Book of ,J ob
Targumized. He calls to the archita-t ἻΝΠΞῙῬ, saying„ Ram him
under the foundation? R. Jose saith, They whelmed him
under a heap of clay. ,ΠἛΠ nrt: ΖΔὛὩ ἾΞἹ Is there cmg] day
in the mountain of the Temple ?'' Gloss: “There was mortar
which they used in building.”

It may be noted, by the by, that they were building in the
Temple in the days of the first Gamaliel, who sat president
in the Sanhedrim about the latter days of our Saviour; which

confirms what Ι already have noted in chap. ii'. 20; and fur-
ther teaches us whence they might have stones in readiness3
for they were now building, and they might have pieces of
stones enough there.
