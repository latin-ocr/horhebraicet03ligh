2. This was no vulgar or ordinary question 116 put here,
“ What shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life 3²² For it
seems plain that 116 was not satisfied in the doctrine of their
schools, about the merit of good works, and justification by
the law: but he thinks there is something more requisite
towards the obtaining salvation, because, after he had (as he
tells us) performed this law from his youth up, he yet in-
quireth further, “What shall I do‚'' ὤας 111 which that 116
was in earliest, our Saviour’s behaviour towards himn suffi-
ciently testified; as also that he came to Jesus, as to no
ordinary teacher, to be instructed 111 this affair.

3. It was very unusual to salute the Rabbins of that nation
with this title. For however they were wont to adora (not
to say lond) either the dead or absent with very splendid
epithets, yet if they spoke to them while present, they gave
them no other title than either Babba, or Mar, 01· Mari. If
you turn over both the Talmuds, I am deceived if you once
find either Good Babba.) or Good Αἶαν.

ΙΙ. So far, therefore, is our Lord in these words from
denying his Godhead, that he rather doth, as it were, draw

thy very acldress to me, and the compellation thou gavest me,
to own me for the Messias : and dost thou take me for God
too as well as man, when thou callest me qood, seeing there is
none good but God only Γ Certainly he saw something that
was not ordinary in this man, when it is said of him that
ἠγάπησεν αὐτὸν, Mark X. 21, lae loved kim: i. 6. 116 spoke
kindly to him, and exhorted him, 810. See 2 Chron. xviii. 2 3
Psalm lxxviii. 36: ἠγάπησαν αὔτὸυ ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν· they
flattered lzz'm with their mouth. Hebrew, ἾΠἾΠέ-ΞΪἾ. Nor is
it an ordinary affection this young man seemed to have for
the blessed Jesus, in that he departs sorrowful from the
counsel that had been given him ; and that he had the person
that had oounselled him in very high esteem, appears in that
he could not without infinite grief reject the eounsel he gave
him.
