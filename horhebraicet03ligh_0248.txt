dreamed their Messiah would do; but he was decked with the
glory, holiness, grace, truth, and the power of miracles,

Ver 16t: Καὶ χάριν ἀντὶ χάριτος· And §racefor yram] He
appeared amongst us full ofyr-ace ancl truth, ,· and all we who
conversed with him, and saw his glory, ‘⁶ of his fulness did re-
ceive” yrace and truth. 'Nay farther, we received yraoe to-
wards the propagation of yram, i. e. the yrace of apostleship,
that we might dispense and propagate the yrace of the gospel
towards others. That ἀντὶ denotes the end or design of a
thing very frequently, there are hardly any but must needs
know.

Ver. 21: ‘O προφήτης εἴ σύ ; Art tlcozo that prophet ἒ] That
is, ‘O προφήτης, εἶς τῶν ἀρχαίων ὃς ἀνέστη, Luke ix. 8, 19, one Qf

I. The Masters of Traditions were wont to say that “the
spirit of prophecy departed from Israel after the death of
Zechariah and Malachi.'' So that we do not find they ex-
pected any prophet till the days of the Messiah3 nor indeed
that any, in that interim of time, (lid pretend to that cha-
racter.

ΙΙ. They believed that at the coming of the Messiah the
prophete were to rise again.

“‘Thyu wat-chmen shall list up the voice, with the voice
together shall they sing? lsaiah lii. ὅ. R. Chaia Bar Abba
and R. J ochanan say, All the prophete shall put forth a song
with one voice.”

“ Allx the just whom God shall raise from the dead shall not
return again into the dust.'’ Gloss‚ “ Those whom he shall
raise ,in the days of the Messiah.''

To this resurrection of the saints they apply that of
Micah v, 5 : ‘⁶ W'ey shall raise against him seven shepherds3
David in the middle, Adam, Seth, Methuselah on his right
hand; Abraham, Jacob, and Moses on his left. And eight
principal men: but who are these? J esse, Saul, Samuel,
Amos, Zephaniah, Zedekiah [or rather Hezekiah, as Kimch.
in loc.], Messiah and Elijah. But indeed [saith R. Solomon]

I do not well know whence they had these things.'' Nor in-
deed do Ι.
