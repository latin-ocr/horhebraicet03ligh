A virqz'nq marries on the fourth, day of the week, and a widow
on the fifth. “ Thiss custom came not in but from the decree
of Ezra, and so onward: for the Sanhedrim doth not sit but
on the second and the fifth days 3 but before the decree of Ezra,
when the Sanhedrim assembled every day, then was it lawful
to take a wife on any day.’' There is a twofold reason given
for this restraint:

I. 0⁸37an Πῇἳζῡ ³:972 The virgin was to be married on
the fourth day of the week because the assembly of the
twenty-three met on the fifth: so that if the husband should
find his wife to be no virgin. but already violated, he might
have recourse to the consistory in the heat of his displeasure,
and procure just punishment for her according to law. But
why then might they not as well marry on the first day of the
week, sceing the Beth Diu met on the second as well as

the fifth?

polluted by preparations for the nuptials : for the first, second,
and third days of the week are allowed for those kind of pre-
parations. And the reason why the widow was to be married
on the first day was, that her husband might rejoice ,with her
for three days together, viZ. fifth, sixth, and the sabbath
day ⁵.

If therefore our bride in this place was a virgin, then the
nuptials were celebrated on the fourth day of the week, which
is our Wednesday z if she was a widow, then she was married
on the fifth day of the week, which is our Thursday. Let us
therefore number our days according to our evangelist, and
let it be but granted that that was the sabbath in which it is
