· (⁴³11. x.] Eaeereitatc‘ons upon ss't. John. 849

ἐν τῷ νΰυ καιρῷ λεῖμμα κατ’ ἐκλογὴν χάριτος γέγονεν, Even So
alcen at this present time also there is a remmam accordiny to the
electz'ooz ofyraee. Which indeed 18, 38 11 were, the gnomon to
that chapter, and, above all other things, does interpret best
the apostle's mind. For he propounds to discourse not con-
cerning the universal call of the J eWS, but of their not being
universally rejected: which may very easily be collected from
the very first verse 0111118 chapter, ‘⁶ Hath Grod cast away his
people 3’' that is, so cast them away that they are universally
rejected. ξι61011 forbid !'’ for I myself am an Israelite, and am
1101 0381 away. This argument he pursues, and illustrates from
the example of those most corrupted times, the age wherein
Elijah lived, when they threw down the altars of God, slew
his prophete, and not 3 few worshipped τὸν Βάαλ, Βααῖ of tlte
Sidoniam, whom Ahab had introduced ; and almost the whole
nation worshipped τὴν Βάαλ, that yolden calf or σοῖο which
J eroboam had set up. And yet, even in that worst state of
affairs, saith God, “I have reserved 10 myself seven thousand
men, who have not bowed the knee τῇ Boiam? to that yolclen
oaff, the common and universal error of that nation, much
less τῷ Βάαλ, to Baal of the Sz'dom'aozs. ‘⁶ Even so'' (saith the
apostle), “ at this present time also there is a remnant 3³³ plainly
intimating, that he does not assert or argue for the calling of
the whole nation, but of that remmam only, and that he dis-
courses concerning the present calling of that remnant, and
not about any future call of the whole nation.

V. That is a vast mystery the apostle 18 upon, ver. 25 of
that chapter; ’Ότι πώρωσις ἀπὸ μέρους τῷ Ἰσραὴλ γέγονεν,
ἄχρις οὗ τὸ πλήρωμα τῶν ἐθνῶν εἰσέλθῃ· Blz'ndness laath severally
happened to Israel, until the salness of the Gentiles be come
inv Ι render ἀπὸ μέρους, severally, or by parts, not without
warrant from grammar, and according to the meaning and
intention of St. Paul. For the mystery mentioned by him
18, 11131 blindness severally, and at several times, happened to
the Israelites: first, the ten tribes were blinded through idol-
atry, and, after many ages, the two tribes, through traditions3
and yet both those and these reserved together to that time,
wherein the Gentiles, who had been blinded for a longer space,
are called, and then both lsraelites and Jews and Gentiles, being
all called together, do 01080 11110 0110 body. It is observable
