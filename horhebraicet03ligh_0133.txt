this particularly, that they laded men with such ‘ yokes ofx
traditions‚' and yet they themselves would not touch or move
them with one of their fingers.

This exposition indeed vulgarly obtains, ‘ Y ou lay grievous
burdens upon others, which in the meantime you indulge
yourselves in, and will not undergo them by any means.'
This interpretation I cannot but admit; but yet must inquire
whether there be not something more included it. For
whereas ⁴ he that would prescribe light things to himself, and
burdensome to others,' was commonly accounted and called
may ὩΨἾ α wichad cunning] fellowy .· and whereas there is
frequent mention of this or that Rabbin, &0237 ³737 ἾᾞΞΠὩΠ
wlco would lay this ον tha-t bardan upon himself, which he would
aequit others of 3 it may be a question, whether this expo-
sition, so commonly received, doth indeed speak out the whole
sense and meaning of these words.

I appoehend, therefore, our Saviour might not only rebuke
the remissness and indulgence they gave themselves, but fur-
ther their strictness and tenaciousness about their own de-
crees. They made light of the commandments of God, at
their own pleasure3 but would never diminish the least tittle
of their own. That they might remove or take away any
part of the divine law, they employ both hands; but as to
their own constitutions, they will not move one finger.

added “the son of Barachias‚'' no one could have doubted
that it referred to any other than Zacharias the son of J e-
