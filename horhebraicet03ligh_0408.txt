making towards Jerusalem to the Passover, he saith, Arise,
let us 90 hence. What he did or said the day before the Pass-
over, while he stayed at Bethany, the evangelist makes no
mention. He only relates what was said in his last farewell
before the paschal supper, and upon his departure from
Bethany. All that we have recorded in chap. xv, xvi, and
xvii, was discoursed to them after the paschal suppert‚ and
after that he had instituted the holy eucharist.

OHA P. XV.

Vm. 1 : Ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ἄμπελος ἡ ἀληθινή· Ι am the true vina]
We may take these words in opposition to what is spoken
concerning Israel. Israel is called a vine, Psalm lxxx. 8;
Isa. v. 73 J er. ii. 21, &c. In Vogjicra Babba ὓ, the parallel is
drawn between I srael and a vine 3 and the similitude is carried
on to sixteen particulars, for the most part improper and un-
suitable enough.

But that which is principally to be regarded in this place
is this, that hitherto, indeed, Israel had been the vine, into
which every one that would betake himself to the worship of
the true God was to be set and grafted in. But from hence-
forward they were to be planted no more into the Jewish
religion, but into the profession of Christ. To which that
in Acts xi. 26 hath some reference, where the disciples
were first called ‘ Christians,’ that is, no longer Jews. οι·
Israelites.

Our Saviour‚ as we have said before, discoursed these things
immediately after that he had instituted the holy eucharist:
while he was ordaining that holy sacrament he had said,
“ This is the new testament in my blood ;” and from thence
immediately adds, I am the true vine: so that for the future
the church is to be under the administration of a new testa-
ment‚ and not, as the J ewish church, under that of the old3
and from henceforward Iam the true vine, into which all the
branches of the church must be ingl-afted‚ and not into the
Israelitish vine any more.

Ver. 3 : ''Hssn ὑμεῖς καθαροί ἐστε· Now ye are oleam] Christ
having discoursed of the vine and os the branches‚ these
