152 Hebraeo and Talmudical [Oh. xiv. 18, &c.

Ver. 18: Ἀπὸ μιᾶς παραιτεῖσθαι· With one consent to make
excuse] A very ridiculous‚ as well as clownish and unman-
nerly excuse this, if it grew towards night3 for it was supper-
time. A very unseasonable time to go and see a piece of
ground new bought, or to try a yoke of oxen. The substan-
tive, therefore, that should answer to the adjective μιᾶς, Ι
would not scel( any otherwhere than as it is included in
the word παραιτεῖσθαι; so that the sense of it may be ἤρξαντο
ἀπὸ μιᾶς αἰτίας παραιτεῖσθαι, they heyam all χὴν one cause to
make excuse, i. e. for one and the same aversation they had
to it.

Ver. 23 z ’Ἔξελθε-εἰς τὰς ὁδοὺς καὶ φραγμούς· Go out inlo the
hiykwayss and laedyes] Into the lciqlaways, that he might bring in
ΞἾΠἾἾΝ the travellers: but who were those that were among
the hedyes. 9 We have a parallel place, 1 Clu on iv ‘These
wele the potterS, Unum :hym ἾᾉΨἾ· in Greek,2 οἱ κατοικοῦυ-
τες ἐν Ἀταὶμ καὶ Γαδιρὰ, These that dwell in Ate-(zm ancl Gadlr.
But the Vulgar. Habzwtantes ιη plantationibus et s opibas‚· dwelliny
in plantations ancl lmdffls, To the same purpose R. Solomon
and Kimchi; “ They employed themselves in making pots, in
planting, in setting hedges, and making mud walls.’' The
Targumist here is very extravagant: “These are those dis-
ciples of the law, for whose sake the world was made3 who
sit in judgment and stablish the world3 and their daughters
build up the waste places of the house of Israel with the pre-
sence of the Eternal Kingf in the service of the law, and the
intercalation of months? &c

Ver. 34: Ἐὰν δὲ τὸ ἅλας μωρανθῇ, &e But e'f tlw salt have
lost his sat-our] This hath a very good connection wit-h what
went before. Our Saviour had before taught how necessary
it was for him that would apply himself to Christ und his re-
ligion, to weigh and consider things beforehand, how great
and difficult things he must undergo, lest when he hath'begun
in the undertaking he faint and go baek3 he apo-statim, and
become uns av oury salt.

Μωραυθῇ suits νει)ς well with the Hebrew word ζ’·ΒΓι
which both signifies ems ιιιυο ω ‘l and n, foed,- “¹7:22 ⁹⁵⁹ ἰῖΞΠ 5:247&
