year than to the lzfz‘yla priest.

Ι. That was the year of pouring out the Spirit of propheey
and revelations beyond whatever the world had yet seen, or
wouldk see again. And why may not some drops of this great
effusion light upon a wieked man, as sometimes the children's
crums fall from the table to the dog under it; that a witness
