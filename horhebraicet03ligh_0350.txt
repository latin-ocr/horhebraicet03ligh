from the traditions of the fathers which are not written in
the laws of Moses: and for that very reason the Sadducees
rejected them, saying, They ought to account nothing as law
or obligatory but what is delivered by Moses; and what
hath no other authority but tradition only ought not to be
observed. And hence have arisen questions and mighty con-
troversies; τῶν μὲν Σαδδουκαίων εὐπόρους μόνον πειθόντων, the
Sadducaes drawing] after them the richer sort only, while the

Hence we may apprehend the reason why the whole San-
hedrim is sometimes comprehended under the name of the
Phari-seem because the common people and the main body
of that nation were wholly at the management of the Pha-
