‘⁶ Thesei> are the criminals tha-t must be stoned3 he that
lieth with his own mother, or with the wife of his father.
He that blasphemes or commits idolat1·y.” Now, however,
the Rabbins differed in the definition of blasphemy or a
blasphemer, yet this all of them agreed in, as unquestionable
blasphemy, that which ‘537'92 amn, denies the foundation.
This they firmly believed J esus did, and none could persuade
them to the contrary, when he affirmed, “ I and my Father

for they would have been like the angels, and had never
begot ten children.”
