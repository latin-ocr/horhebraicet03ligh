the number of the people here present were at least twenty
thousand, but a very great number. So AQcts xxi. 20: Πόσαι
μυριάδες εἰσὶν Ἰουδαίων τῶν πεπιστευκότων, How momgej myriads
ef Jews which believe.

This probably denotes the mighty success of the seventy
disciples preaching the gospel, who had so clearly and effect-
ually taught concerning Christ, and told them of the places
that he had determined to come to, that the people had
flocked together in those vast numbers, ready upon all occa-
sions to meet him, when they heard the Messias was making
his approaches to this or that town.

Ver. 3 : AO πρὸς τὸ οὓς ἐλαλήσατε· ΤΙιατ which yse have spoken

in Eccles. x, 20. Our Saviour intimates the folly as well as
the wickedness of dissimulati0n‚ because in time the visor
shall be taken off, and the most dissembled hypocrisy exposed
to naked view.

five sparrows sold for two fartlcinys .P] Two sparrows were
sold for one farthing0‚ and five for two. We find that doves
were sold in the Temple upon the account of women in child-
