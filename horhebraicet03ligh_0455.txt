CHAP. XXI.

Vna. 2: Σίμων Πέτρος, καὶ Θωμᾶς, &c. Simon Peter, and
Thomas, &ej Here are seven of the disciples mentioned, and
but five of them named. Those two whose names are not
recited probably were Philip and Andrew3 as the four that
were absent at the time were the sons of Alpheus, Matthew,
Judas, Simeon, and James. Compare those that are men-
tioned, chap.i; and you may reasonably suppose the person
not named there, ver. 37. 40, might be Thomas.

Ver. 3 ε ’Ὑπάγω ἁλιεύειν· Ι 90 afiskz‘ny] Christ had ordered
his apostles to meet him at a mountain in Galilee, Matt.
xxviii. 16. It is plain, ver. 14, that he had not yet appeared
to them there: so that it is something strange how they dui-st
keep away from that mountain, and how the four newly men-
tioned durst be absent from the rest of their number.
They knew the mountain without doubt; and if they knew
not the time wherein Christ would make his appearance
amongst them, why should they not abide continually there in
attendance for him?

It should seem, that they did not look for him till the
Lord's day, which had not yet been since they were come
into Galilee. And perhaps the sons of Alpheus had, in their
return from Jerusalem, betaken themselves amongst their
relations, determining to be at that mountain on the Lord's
day. These seven dwelt not far off the mountain, which was
near Capernaum, and hard by the sea of Galilee: only Na-
thanael, who dwelt more remote in Cana, towards the extreme
north parts of that sea. He was not yet gone home, but,
waiting the appointed time, stayed here. Peter and Andrew
dwelt in Capernaum, and so, probably, did J ames and John :
Philip in Bethsaida, and Thomas (as we may conjecture from
his Greek name Didymus) probably lived amongst the Syro-
Grecians in Gadara, or Hippo, or some place in that country
of Decapolis, not very far from Gennesaret.
