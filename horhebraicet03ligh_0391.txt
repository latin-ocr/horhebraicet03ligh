Jacob. Hence that which we have quoted already: “The
holy blessed God saith to the nations of the world, Your
prinoe could not stand before him.” Your prime, that is, the
prince of the nations, whom the Rabbins talk of as appearing
to Jacob rin-12 ὓἾῑΔΟἷῬὉἾΝ in the shape of Archidamo, or
a chief robber. And R. Ohaninah Bar Chama saith, (Ἅι) ww
ΠἿΠ Wyy ke was the prinae of Esau, i. e. the prince of Edom.
Now “the prince of Edom was Samaelh.”

They have a fiction that the seventy nations of the world
were committed to the government of so many angels [they
will hardly allow the Gentiles any good ones] z which opinion
the Greek version favours in Deut. xxxii. 83 “ When the
Most High divided the nations'' [into seventy, say they],
“when he separated the sons of Adam, ἔστησεν ὅρια ἐθυῶυ
κατὰ ἀριθμὸν ἀγγέλων Θεοῦ, ke set the bounds of the nations ac-
cordiny to tlze number qf the anyels of God.” Over these princes
they conceive one monarch above them all, and that is Samael,
the angel ῳ( death, the arch-devil.

Our Saviour therefore speaks after their common way when
he calls the devil tlte prime of this world: and the meaning of
the phrase is made the more plain, if we set it in opposition
to that Prince ‘ whose kingdom is not of this world,' that is,
the Prince of the world to come. consult Heb. ii. 5.

How far that prince of the nations of the world had ex-
ercised his tyranny amongst the Gentiles, leading them cap-
tive into sin and perdition, needs no explaining. Our Saviour
therefore observing at this time some of the Greeks, that 18,
the Gentiles, pressing hard to see him, he joyfully declares,
that the time is coming on apace wherein this prince must
be unseated from 1118 throne and tyranny: “And Ι, when I
shall be lifted up upon the cross, and by my death shall de-
stroy him who hath the power of death, then will [draw all
nations out of his dominion and power after me.'’
