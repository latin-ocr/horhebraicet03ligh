but then (the whole canon of the Old Testament being per-
fected and made up) it departed, not returning till the dawn
of the gospel, at what time it appeared in inspiring the blessed
Virgin, John Baptist and his parentS‚ &az and yet “the
Holy Ghost was not yet come‚'’ that is, not answerably to
that large and signal promise of it in J oel ii. 28.

Ver. 49: ‘O ὄχλος οὗτος· Ticis people, &off ΫἾΝ 037 The

Ver.52: Μὴ καὶ σὺ ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας εἷς Art thou also of

Galileans that believe in this Galilean ἒ”

CHA P. VIII.S

Exposrroezs, almost with one consent, do note that this story
of the woman taken in adultery, was not in some ancient
copies; and whiles l am considering upon what accident this
should be, there are two little stories in Eusebius that come
to mind. The one we have in these wordst‚ Ἐκτέθειται δὲ καὶ
ἄλληυ ἱστορίαν περὶ γυναικὸς, ἐπὶ πολλαῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὃιαβληθείσης
ἐπὶ τοῦ Κυρίου· ἢν τὸ καθ’ εΕβραιόυς εὐαγγέλιον περιέχει· He
[Papias] tells us also another history concerwinyu woman αο-
cased of many crimes befhre our Lord, which history indeed the
Gospel accordiny to the Hebrews makes mention of. All that
do cite that story do suppose he means this adulteress. The
other story he tells us in his Life of Constantineu: he brings
in Constantine writing thus to him: Πρέποι) κατεφάνη τὸ δη-
λῶσαι τῇ σῇ συνέσει, ὅπως ἂν πεντήκοντα σωμάτια ἐν διφθέραις
ἐγκατασκεύοις εὐαυάγνωστά τε, καὶ πρὸς χρῆσιν εὖμετακόμιστα, &a ’
“Ι think good to signify to your prudence‚ that you would
take care that fifty volumes of those Scriptures, whose pre-
paration and use you know so necessary for the church, and
which beside may be easily read and carried about, may, by
very skilful penmen‚ be written out in fair [politiori] parch-
menff'

So indeed the Latin interpreter: but may we not by the
word σωμάτια understand the Gospels compacted into one
