we said, of the diseiples’ asking the doetors questions in the
court, but that the reader might have a little sight of the man-
ner of that court, and how there were many, not only of the
disciples of the WVise, but others, too, that floeked thither.

We may further add: ‘⁶ Iny a city where there are not
two great wise men, one fit to teach and instruct in the whole
law, the other who knows how to hear, and ask, and answer,
they do not constitute a Sanhedrim, although there were a
thousand Israelites there,”' &a ‘⁶ Inz a city where there are
not two that may speak, and one that may hear, they do not
constitute a Sanhedrim. In Bitt-er, there were three: In
J abneh four ; viz. R. Eliezer‚ R. Josliua, R. Akibah, and Simeon
the Temanite. ὩΠἾΡΞ ΞΠὋΞῖὩ ῙἾ Hejzadyed before them, sitting]
οη the fyrozmdss' By him wlco hears they mean one skilful in the
traditione, that ean propound questions, and answer every
question propounded. Such a one was Simeon the Temanite;
who though he was a man os that learning, yet, not being pro-
moted to become one of the elders, he sat upon the ground3
that is, not on any of the benehes of the fathers of a the San-
hedrim3 but U‘LJ’DDD2 οη one of the seats that were near the
ground ; for they speak these things as done in the times
after the death of Gamaliel. There is nothing absurd there-
fore in it, if we should suppose Christ gotten into the very
Sanhedrim itself. Thither J oseph and his mother might come,
and seeking him, might find him on the benehes of the fathers
of the couneil for that time, they having found him so capable
both to propound questions and answer them. For it is plain
they did admit of others, for other reasons, to sit some-
times in their seatsb. And it is less wonder if they suffer him
to sit amongst them, being but twelve years of age, when as
they promoted R. Eleazar Ben Azariah to the presidency itself
when he was but sixteen C. But if it was in a lower court, it-
is still less wonder if he sat amongst them. But that which
might be chiefly inquired is, whether Christ sat amongst them
as one of their disciples3 This indeed is hardly eredible.
