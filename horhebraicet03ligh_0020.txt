ρεύθησαν τοῖς δικαιώμασι τῶν ἐθνῶν, She„ ancl walked in tlte
‘statutas’ of the heathen.

The word δικαιώματα is frequently rendered by those in-
terpreters from ἶΞῬἹΠ and ,ΠἸΡἸΠς which, to wave all other
instances, may abundantly appear from Psalm cxix. And the
very things which the Jews speak of the Hebrew word obtain

just and equal, deriving their equity from the authority of
him that ordained them.
