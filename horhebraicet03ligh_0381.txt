Ch. xii. 3.] Emercitatabns upon St. John. 375

whether Mary the sister of Lazarus was the same with
Mary Magdalene, this passage will help a little towards the
affirmative, that there was a town called Magdala very near
Jerusalem.

&bum'rss‘ ΝἾΞΒ “A clerk or scribe at Allaydala set his
candles in order every evening of the sabbath, went up to
Jerusalem, prayed there, returned and lighted up his candles
when the sabbath was now coming in.”

It seems plain by this, that Magdala and Jerusalem were
not very far distant from one another, when all this was done
so quickly, and in so short a space of time. Only we may
learn this from the Gloss, that that Magdala 3772'2 ΝὛΠ
D'DZR was Illaydala Zebaim .· coneerning which that sad and
direful passage is related, that ‘⁸ it was destroyed for its
adulteries.''

“ Theret were three cities whose customs were carried to
J erusalemz’' Gloss: “ ln wagons, because of their great

and Magdala. Why was ³752: Cabul destroyed? Because of
their discords. Why was *su-rw Siclzin destroyed? Because
of the magic arts they used. And why was Magdala destroyed?

&5³92ss 57:122 Maydala Zabaaia. Το this place it was that
R. Jonathan once betook himself sor some cure to his bald-
nessu.

Now therefore what should hinder but that Mary the
sister of Lazarus of Bethany might be called Magdalene, both
for the nearness of the town, where perhaps she was married,
and also for the lascivious manners of the townsfolks, with
which spot it is commonly believed Mary Magdalene had been
tainted'!

In this passage there were two things very unusual :

Ι. It was indeed a very common thing to anoint the feet
with oil; but to do it with aromatical ointment, this was
more rarely done. And it is charged by the Gemarists as a
great crime, that the Jerusalem women of old anointed their
