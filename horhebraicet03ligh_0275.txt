Oh. iii. 2 5.] Emercz'tations upon St. Jolm. 269

“ Thel morning cometh, and also the night,' Isa. xxi.1 2. It
will be the morning to Israel [when the Messiah shall come] ;
but it will be night to the nations of the world.''

“ R. Abin saithm, That the Holy Blessed God will make the
elders of Israel sit down in a semicircle, himself sitting presi-
dent, as the father of the Sanhedrim; and shall judge the
nations of the world.''

“ Then ¹¹ comes the thrashing3 the straw they throw into the
fire, the chaff into the wind; but the wheat they keep upon
the floor: so the nations of the world shall be as the burning
of a furnace3 but Israel alone shall be preserved.''

I could be endless in passages of this nature out of these
authors: but that which is very observable in all of them is
this; That all those curses and dreadful judgments which God
in his holy writ threatens against wicked men, they post it off
wholly from themselves and their own nation, as if not at all
belonging to them, devolving all upon the Gentiles and the
nations of the world. So that it was not without great reason
that the apostle asserteth, Rom. iii. 19, “ Whatsoever things
the law saith, it saith to them which are under the law.’'
Which yet they will by no means endure.

Christ, therefore, by this kind of phrase or scheme of
speech, well enough known to Nicodemus, teacheth him
(contrary to a vulgar opinion, which he also could not be
ignorant of), that the Messiah should become a Redeemer
and propitiation, as well to the Gentiles as to the Jews,
They had taught amongst themselves, that God had no re-
gard to the nations of the world, they were odious to him,
and the Messiah, when he came, would destroy and condemn
them: but the Truth saith, “ God so loved the world, that he
hath sent his Son not to condemn, but to save the world.”
This very evangelist himself is the best commentator upon
this expression, 1 John ii. 2 3 “ He is the propitiation for our
sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole
world ;'' i. e. not for us Jews only, but for the nations of tlte
world.
