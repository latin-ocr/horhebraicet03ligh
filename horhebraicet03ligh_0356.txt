350 Heln-m and Talmudz'cal [Ch. Χ. ι. “

that the apostle‚ throughout this whole chapter, doth not
so much as onoe make mention of the Jews, but of Israelk,
that he might include the ten tribes with the two within his
disoourse.

And, indeed, this great Shepherd had his flook, or his sheep,
within the ten tribes, as well as within the two: and to me it
is without all controversy that the gospeL in the times of the
apostles, was brought and preaohed as well to the one as the
other. Doubtless St. Peter, whilst he was in Babylon, preaohed
to the Israelites dispersed in those countries as well as to the
Jews.

VI. Some of the Gemarists do vehemently deny any eon-
version of the ten tribes under the Messiah: let them beware
lest there be not a conversion of their own.

⁶⁶ The¹ ten tribes shall never return, as it is written, ⁶ And
he east them into anothe1 land, ts it is this dayss Deut.
xxix. 28. ‘As this day passeth and shall neve1 letum, so they
are gone and shall not return again. They are the w·01 ds oi
R. Akibahff’

“ It1s a tradition of the Rabbins‚ that the ten tribes shall
not have a part in the world to come3 as it is written, ‘ The
Lord rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath,
and in great indignation‚ and east them out into another

, land. He rooted them out of their own land in this world,

and cast them out into another land in the world to come.’
They are the words of Rabbi.”

But, in truth, when the true Messiah did appear, the ten
tribes were more happily called (ifI may so speak), that is,
with more happy success than the J ews3 because amongst
those Jews that had embraced the gospel, there happened a
sad and foul apostasy‚ the like to which we read not of eon-
cerning the ten tribes that were eonverted.

they should stray; and where they might be safe from thieves
or wild beasts.
