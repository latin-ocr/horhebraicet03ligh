124 Hebraeo and Talmudical [Ch. xi. 45.

’ΞΝ Ι am a, Disciple‚ *1³17* ΠἿἾΠῙὮ ’ἿἾΝἾ ³3³& I am not fit to
be made α Sirzgmlar.'’ The Glo'ss hath it, “ 1 am not· fit to
begin the fasts with the Singulars.’' And the Gomara a
little ast-erg ‘⁶ The Rabbins have a tradition: Every one that
would make himself a Simulum let him not make himself so:
but if any one would make himself a Diseiple, let him.'’
And at lengun num-m :12:³³7 *swa nnn rii-m ΓΝ
It is not Zaztfal for α Disciple of the lee to continue in

tlte work of God: that is, he eeaseth from learning and
teaohing.

Oneq would here think, that it is plainly distinguished be-
twixt a Pharisee and any other3 and yet the Gemarists, in
the very same place, say thus, ΞἾἾἾΠἾ &nnn *umbri ¹7:
All the Discz'ples of tlte W ise are Singyulars. At. length they
query, ἾἿῸῖὩΠ ἸΠῖἿζήἹ ἾἾΠἾ ww& ίζῑῘῘΙιο is a Sinqular, ancl
wlco z's α Dis-ciple ? A ιδ’ἰηρῑιῖαν is he that is worthy
wira-1 ἓν nrm iri-nn& to be profem-ed to be a pastor of
α synaqoyue. A Disciple is he, who if they ask him any
thing eoncerning a tradition in his doctrine, he hath where-
withal to ansxver.” So that by a Disciple they mean not him
that is now learning, but him who hath already learned and
now teacheth3 but, in other places, they apply both these to
the Disciple.

‘⁶ R. J ochananr saith, Who is a Disciple of the W ise? he ι
whom they prefer to be pastor of a synagogue: he who, if
they ask him about any tradition in any place, hath where-
withal to answer.'' The differenoe between these, however
confounded in this place, was this: that TDLA-5 the Disciple
could answer doubts and questions fetehed out of that place
or from that subject upon which he had taught or read 3 but

ἿἿΠἾ the Sinyulmg could answer all doubts 3375& ΕἹῘΞὮ ³7:2¹.
mlv: 55:002 raised from any] place, even out qs the treatise
concerniny marriaqes. That mention of the pastor and the
teaclcer, Eph. iv. 1 1, we seem to have some shadow of it here ε
*Umbri the Disciple is tlte toacher, and ἻἾΠἾ the Sinyular is
the pastor qf the sfflzayoyue: and perhaps if these things were

observed‚ it might give some light into that place of the ”
apostle.
