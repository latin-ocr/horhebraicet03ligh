were ambitious to be inspired os the devil amongst tombs
and unclean places; and those also, who, being involuntarily
possessed by the devils, betook themselves amongst tombs
and such places of uncleanness. And whether they upon
whom the devil inflicted unclean diseases should be ranked
in the same degree, I do not determine. There were others
who were not acted by such diabolical furies, but afflicted
with other kind of diseases, whom they accounted under
the operation ἿῙῚἸΠ ripn ΠἾἾ qf an evil spirit of diseas-e or
infirmitgs. Not ἀκαθαρσίας, of uncleamzess ; but ἀσθενείας, of
infirmity. And perhaps the evangelist speaks according to
this antithesis, that this woman had neither a spirit of zm-
deameess, according to what they judged of a spirit of un—
eleanness3 nor νόσον ἀκαθαρσίας, α cli-§ease of uncleanness; but
πνεῦμα ἀσθενείας, α spirit of infirmity.

How far a beust qoiny forth. VVhere it is very much cautioned
that the beast be not brought out on the sabbath day carry-
ing any thing upon him that might be a burden not per-
mitted to be borne on that day. They allow ‘mm &27²
ἿΞΞΝΞ that α camel be led out with α baller, ἾἺΒΞ, Dio a
horse with α collar, ἅπας that is, when they are led out either
to pasture or watering. Nay, the Gloss upon the place adds,
“that they may lead out the horse to the water, that he
may dip the collar in the water if the water be unclean.''

ΤοΕ this may be referred that abstruse and obscure rule

ΓΕΒῩ mvn> concerning the building of mounds about a
spring that belongs to a private man, with that art that the
beast, being led thither to watering on the sabbath day, shall
not go out of the place that is of common right.
, Its is not only permitted to lead the beast out to water-
ing on the sabbath day, but they might draw water sor him,
and pour it into troughs, provided only that they do not
carry the water, and set it before the beast to drink3 but
the beast come and drink it of his own accord.
