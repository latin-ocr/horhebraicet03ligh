lf any one hesitate about the changing of the name, let
him say by what name he finds Jehoiada recited in that
catalogue of priests set down in 1 Chron. vi. It must be
either some other name, or else we must suppose him wholly
left out of that number. If by another name, you will say
(supposing he be also called Baraehias) he was then a man
of three names. This indeed is no unusual thing with that
nation for some to have more names than one: nay, if you
will believe the Jewish doetors‚ even Moses himself had 110
less than 1611 f.

Ver. 52: '‘Hpare τὴν κλεῖδα τῆς γνώσεως· Ye have taken
away tlce key of knowledye] Should we render 11, Ye leave
taken tlte hey of knowledye, (that is, to yourselves3) or, Ye
have taken it away; there is not much differenee. They took
the hey of knowledye te themselves, when th-ey arrogated to
themselves only all profoundness of wisdom and learning,
hereby indeed taking] it away from the people, because they
taught them nothing but trifling and idle stuff'.

The word for key being in their language ΝΠΠΞῸ brings
10 mind the word ΠΓἾΞ), which was so very much in use
amongst them for one that was teaekz'ny. Instanees of this
were endless: there are enough of it in that long prefaee pre-
fixed to that Midras Tha-enorum, that hath for its title
”2³:177 ΝΠΠἾΓἾΞ), The openinys ef the wz'se; where (as indeed
almost everywhere else g), it is so frequently said, ΠΠΞ) ’Ἴ
R. such a one ⁶ opened ,·' for I cannot tell how betterh to render
it. I know indeed that ΠΠΞ) oft-entimes signifies he beqan:
to which is opposed Dru-1 01· '0⁸³0 ke ended: but here it is
used when any Rabbin produceth any text of Scripture, and
either glosseth or discourseth upon it by way of exposition,
allusion, or allegory: “ While he opened to us the &ripun-esi?
There is no one that observes the places, but· will easily sup-
pose there is more signified by the expression than mere
opening} his mouth.
