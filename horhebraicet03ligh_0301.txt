especially when the spirit of prophecy‚ appearance of angels,
and working of miracles, had been things so long unwonted

in the sea of Tiberias.

Which very miracle this nation hath formerly experienced,

proach of the enemy and destroyer‚ it is less wonder that
there should be some miraculous appearances there, though
