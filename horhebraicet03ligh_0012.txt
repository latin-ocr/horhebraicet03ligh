writings in such a balance as that it may appear they are
neither rejected by him as false or heretical‚ nor yet received

which the heavenly preachers had delivered to themb3 not the
latter, for to those writings he opposeth, that he himself was
παρακηλουθηκὼς ἄνωθεν, one that had perfect understandiny (gf

Ἀνατάξασθαι διήγησιν· To sel forth in order α declaration]
