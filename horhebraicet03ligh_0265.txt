spake of the temple oflcis body] If we consider how much the
second Temple came behind that of the first, it will the moro
easily appear why our blessed Saviour should eall his body the
Temple.

‘⁴ In)⁷ the second Temple there wanted the Firo from heaven,
the Ark with' the Propitiatory and Cherubims, Urim and
Thummim, ΠΞὉΨ the Divino Glorgs, the Holy Ghost, and the
anointing Oil.’⁷

These things were all in Solomon's Temple, which therefore
was aceounted a full and plenary type of the Messiah: but so
long as the second Temple had them not, it wanted what more
particularly shadowed and represented him.

Ι. There was indeed in the second Temple a certain ark
in the Holy of Holies; but this was neitherz Moses”s ark nor
the ark of the covenanta: which may not unfitly eome to mind
when we read that passage, Rev. xi. 19, ‘⁸ The Temple of God
was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his Temple the
ark os his testalnent.” It was not seen, nor indeed was it at
all in the second Temple.

The Jews have a tradition, that J osias hid the ark before
the Babylonish eaptivity, lest it should fall into the hands of
the enemy, as once it did amongst the Philistinesb3 but there
is no mention that it was ever found and restored again.

H. In Moses’s Tabernaele and Solomon's Temple the divine
presence sat visibly over the Ark in the Propitiatory, in a
cloud of glory: but when the destruction of that Temple drew
near, it went up from the Propitiatory, Ezek. x. 4, and never
returned into the second Temple, where neither the Ark nor
the Propitiatory was ever restored.

III. The high priest, indeed, ministered in the second
Temple as in the first, in eight several garmentsc. Amongst
these was the pectoral, or breastplate, wherein the preeious
stenes were put (out of which the jasper chaneed to fall and
was lostd) : but the oraele by Urim and Thummim was never
restored: see Ezra ii. 633 Neh. vii. 63. And if not restored
