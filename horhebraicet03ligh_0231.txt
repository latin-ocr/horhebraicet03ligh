Ch. xxiv. 44] Exercitations upon St. Lake. 225

Photius judgeth him a corrupt author: besides that it may
be shewn by and by, that there was a twofold Ootocteuch be—
sides that of Moses. Now if any man should ask, how it
come to pass that Eulogius (and that probably from the
common notion of the thing) should divide the books of
Moses into an Octateuch3 I had rather any one else than
myself should resolve him in it. But if any consent that he
owned the Heptateuch we have already mentioned, we should
be ready to reckon the last chapter of Deuteronomy for the
eighth part.

Aben Ezra will smile here, who in that his obscure and dis-
guised denial of the books of the Pentateuch, as if they were
not writ by the pen of Moses, instances, in that cha-pter in
the first place, as far as I can guesS, as a testimony against
it. You have his wordsx in his Oommentary upon the Book
of Deuteronomy, a little from the beginning, ἿἾΕ) wlff DNW
’ἸἎἹῩ Ἶῑζῖᾨ &mm-1 But zf you understand the mystery of the
twelve, 850„ i. e. of the twelve verses of the last chapter of the
book (for so his own countrymen expound him), “ thou wilt
know the truth;'’ i. e. that Moses did not write the whole
Pentatezoch3 an argument neither worth answering, nor be-
coming so great a philosopher. For as it is a ridiculous thing
to suppose that the chapter that treats of the death and
burial of Moses should be written by himself, so would it not
be much less ridiculous to affix that chapter to any other
volume than the Pentateuch. But these things are not the
proper subject for our present handling.

ΙΙ. There also was an Octateuch of the prophets too: ‘⁶ Allz
the books of the prophets are eight 3 Joshua, Judges, Samuel,
Kiugs, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, and the twelve.’' For the
historical books also were read in their synagogues under the
notion of the prophets, as well as the prophets themselves,
whose names are set down. You will see the title prefixed to
them in the Hebrew Bibles, ΞὊἾΨΝἾΠ ΕἾΝἾΞΠΠ The former
prophets, as well as to the others, ΞἾἹἾΠΝ Dus-⁴2] lee latter
prophets. The doct-ors give us the reason why they dispose
the prophets in that order, that Jeremiah is named first,
Ezekiel next, and Isaiah last, which I have quoted in notes
