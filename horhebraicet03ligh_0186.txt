180 Hebrew and Talmudz'eal [Oh. xvii. 12.

That there were certain places where they that were un-

clean by that disease of the Zeprosy were secluded, reason
might persuade us: for it were an inhuman thing to cast
thee leprous out of·tl1e city without any provision of a
dwelling for them, but that they should always lie sub clio,
in the open air. Whether there was any such thing in this
place, I will not determine. It seems as if these ten lepers,
having heard of our Saviour’s coming that way, were got but
lately together to attend him there. For when the seventy
disciples had beforehand openly proclaimed, in all the places
where he was to come, that he would come thither, it is easy
to conceive in what infinite throngs the sick, and all that were
affected with any kind of distemper, would be crowding thither
for a cure.
“ ΙΙ. Ε’ΨΞἻΝΞΓἾΠΕἿΠῸῸ DUDL) mmm *mmm “The ἱερᾶν
that transgressetlz lais bouozds, let him receive forty stripes.
Those that have their issues, men or women, if they trans-
gress their limits, let them also receive forty stripes.’'
Where the Gloss is, “ The limits for those that have their
issues are the Mountain of the House‚ or the Oourt of the
Gentiles: for they are forbid to enter into the camp of the
Levites. The unclean are not excluded but from the Gourt ε
excepting those that have their issues and a gonorrhoea
upon them; they are excluded even from the Mountain of
the House3 and the ἱερᾶν, who is excluded from the camp of
Israel, that is, from the city.'’

Now the camp of Israel, out of which the lepor was to be
excluded, they interpreted to be every city that had been
walled from the days of Joshua: “ For (say they) Joshua
sanctified the walled cities with the holiness that was as-
cribed to the camp of Israel ‚· but he did not so to the rest
of the land, nor the cities that had no walls.'' This was a
village, and not such a city, where these ten lepers meet our
Saviour3 and if they were within this village, it was neither
beyond the custom nor the rule, provided that they kept but
their distance.
