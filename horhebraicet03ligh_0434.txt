428 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xviii. 31.

We will not contend about the time when these forty years
should first begin; though Ι am apt to think they might begin
about half a year before Christ's death. The words which we
have under consideration, spoken by the Sanhedrim to Pilate,
seem to refer wholly to the reason we have already mentioned:
“ It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.'' Why is it
not lawful? Because, being forced by the necessity of the times,
we retired from the 100111 Gazfflz, where if we sit not, neither
we ourselves nor any court under us can take any cognizance
of causes of life and-death.

But what necessity of times could urge you to remove? So
greatly did the criminals multiply‚ and grew to such a head,
that we neither could nor durst animadvert upon them, ac-
cording to what the majesty of the place might expect and
require from us if we should sit in Gazith.

That must be observed in the evangelists, that when they
had had Christ in examination in the palace of the high priest
all night, in the morning t-he whole Sanhedrim met, that they
might pass sentence of death upon him. Where then was
this that they met? Questionless in the room Gazz'tlz,· at least
if they adhered to their own rules and' constitutions : “ Thither
they betook themselves sometimes upon urgent necessity.”
The Gloss before quoted excepts “ only the case of murder;''
which, amongst all their false accusations, they never charged
Ohrist- with.

But however suppose it were granted that the great council
met either in the Tabernce or some other place, (which yet by
no means agreed with their own tradition‚) did they deal
truly, and as the matter really and indeed was, with Pilate‚
when they tell him, “It is not lawful for us to put any man to
death 3'' He had said to them, “ Take ye him, andS judge him
according to your law.’' We have indeed judged and con-
demned him, but we cannot put any one to death. Was this
that they said in fact true? How came they then to stone
the protomartyr Stephen? How came they to stone Ben Satda
at Lyddat? How came they to burn the priest's daughter
alive that was taken in adulteryu?

It is probable they had not put any one to death as yet,
