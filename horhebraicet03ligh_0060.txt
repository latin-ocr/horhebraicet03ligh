Τοῦ ‘HM‘ Which was the son ofHeli.] I. There is neither
need nor reason, nor indeed any foundation at all, for us to
frame I know not what marriages, and the taking of brothers'
wives, to remove a scruple in this place, wherein there is *really
no scruple in the least. For,

1. Josephf is not here called the son ofHelz‘, but Jesus is
so: for the word Jesus, viz. υἱὸς, not υἱοῦ, must be under-
stood, and must be always added in the reader’s mind to

, every raee in this genealogy, after this manner: “ 505115 (as

was supposed) the son of 5 oseph, and so the son of Heli, and
of Matthat, yea and, at length, the son of Adam, and the
Son of God.” For it was very little the business of the
evangelist either to draw J oseph's pedigree from Adam, or,
indeed, to shew that Adam was the son of God: which not
only sounds something harshly, but in this place very enor-
mously, I may almost add, blasphemously' too. For when
St. Luke, ver. 22, had made [dz‘oeerat] a voice from heaven,
declar-ing that J esus was the Son of God, do we think the
same evangelist would, in the same breath, pronounce Adam
‘ the song of God' too? So that this very thing -teacheth us
what the evangelist propounded to himself in the framing of
this genealogy 3 which was to shew that this 5 esus, who had
newly received that great testimony from heaven, ‘⁴ This is
my Son,'' was the very same that had been promised to Adam
by the seed of the woman. And for this reason hath he
drawn his pedigree on the mother's side, who was the
daughter of Heli, and this too as high as Adam, to whom
this J esus was promised. In the close of the genealogy‚ he
teacheth in what sense the former part of it should be taken ;
viz. that J esus, not 5 oseph, should be called the son of Heli,
and consequently, that the same J esus, not Adam, should be
called the Son of God. Indeed, in every link of this chain
this still should be understood, ⁵‘ Jesus the son of Matthat,
Jesus the son of Levi, Jesus the son of Melchi;'’ and so of
the rest.
