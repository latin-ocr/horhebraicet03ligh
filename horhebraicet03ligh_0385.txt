ofpczlm trees, let us add only in this place, what 18 discoursed
by the Rabbins concerning the ‘ ivy of the palm trees,' much
used in the Passover. ‘⁶ Ik have heard from him ΓΝΒἾἿ
ΠΟΞΠ ΓῖὩΞρἾῺΞ that they perform their service by Arkablin.
But what is Arkablz'n? Resh Lachish saith, &nwffirl ΝΠἾἾΞΝ
Α twiy twined about.qq Gloss : “ A thick sprig that grows up
about the palm tree, folds about it, and runs upon it.'' I
could not tell better how to render this than by the ‘ ivy of
the palm tree.' They used, as it should seem, the leaves of
that frequently amongst, or instead of, the bitter herbs which
they were to eat with the paschal lamb. So far they had to
do with the palm tree in all other Passovers, viz. to crop the
ivy off of them: but here they use the palm branchos thern-
selves, as in the feast of TabernacleS. A matter not to be
passed over without wonder, and cannot but bring to mind
Zech. xiv. 16, and John vii. ὃ.

Ver. 19: ‘O κόσμος ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ ἀπῆλθεν The world is yone

after him] The Talmudists would say, 2753& &723737 &³772
ΠἾἾΠΞ, All tlze world ‘is yone after him.

Ver. 20: ''Hffav δέ τινες “Ἐλληυες’ There were certain Greeks]
That these Greeks were Gentiles, as the Vulgar renders it, I
do not question; and perhaps they were Syro-Grecians,· and
those either of Decapolis, or Gadara, or Hippo: the reason
of this conjecture is, partly, that they apply themselves to
Philip of Bethsaida, as known to them, because of his
neighbourhood, partly, which is more probable, that those
Greeks that bordered upon Galilee and the places where
Christ wrought his miracles, might seem more prone both to
embrace the J ewish religion, and also to see J esus, than those
that lived further off.

However, be they other Gentiles, and not Greeks,· or be
they Greeks come from more remote countries, what had the
one or the other to do with the feast, or the religion of the
J ews? As to this, let the J ewish writers inform us.

country, and withal send drink offerings, the drink offerings
are offered: but if he send no drink offerings‚ drink offerings
are offeredm at the charge of the cong1·egation.” Observe
