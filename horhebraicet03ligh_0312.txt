I. They looked (as hath b‘een already said) for the resur-
rection of the dead at the coming of the Messiah. Take
one instance: “ R. Jeremiaha said, ‘ then Ι die, bury me in
my shirt, and with my shoes οη, &c.; that when Messiah
comes I may be ready dressed to meet him) ''

Apply here the words of our Saviour: “ Ye look for the
resurrection when Messiah coxnes3 and since ye seek a sign
of me, perhaps ye have it in your minds that I should raise
some from the dead. Let this suffice, that whoever comes to
me andb believes in me shall be raised up ἐν ἐσχάτῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ,
at the last day.”

generation in the wilderness. “ The generation in the wil-
derness have no part in the world to come, neither shall they

Now as to this generation in the wilderness, there had
been some discourse before, ver. 31 3 viz. of those that had

that believe in me, ἀναστήσω ἐν τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ, I will walse

world to come.’'
