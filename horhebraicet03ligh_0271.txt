Hence that passage, mn :2³7wa ,72:³7 nn‘v w* Smin* ³7:³7
There is α part allotted to all Israel in tlte world to come‚· that
is, in the partieipation of tlze Ilsessiah. But whence comes it
that universal Israel claim such a part? Merely because they
are Israelites3 i. e. merely because they come of the stock
and lineage of lsrael. Our Saviour sets himself against this
error of theirs, and teacheth that it is not enough for them
to be the children of Abraham, or the stock of Israel,
to give them any title to or interest in the Messiah 3 but
they must further be born ἄνωθεν, from above ,· they must
' claim it by a heavenly, not an eartklgs birth. These words of
his seem to fall in and bear the same kind of sense with those
of John Baptist [Matth. iii. 9.], “Think not to say within
yourselves, We have Abraham to our father.''

III. The Jews acknowledged, in order to proselytism,
some kind of regeneration or new birth absolutely necessary:
but then this was very slightly and easily attainable. ἿἎΥ
’ *rhum TlmpD *⁷27 mmmm, If any one become a proselyta, ke
is like α child new born. But in what sense is he so?

“ Thez Gentile that is made a proselyte, and the servant
that is made free, behold, he is like a child new born. ³737
*uva Ἶζήω And all those relations he laad whiles either Gentile
or servant, they now cease from being so. By the law it is
lawful for a Gentile to marry his mother, or the sister of his
mother, if they are proselyted to the J ewish religion. But
the wise men have forbidden this, lest it should be said,
We go downward from a greater degree of sanctity to a less ;
and that which was forbidden yesterday is allowable to-day.”
Compare this with 1 Gor. v. 1.

Christ teaches another ,kind of new birth, requisito for those
that partake of the kingdom of the Messiah‚ beyond what
they have either as Israelites or proselytes ς viz„ that they
should be born from above, or bys α celestial yeneration, which
only makes them capable of the kinydom of heaven.
