next day. It is now called Napolis: Jaeob's well is near it,
the waters of it sweet as milk.

March 29, they went from Sychar towards Jerusale1n3 the
nearer to which place they came, the more barren and un-
pleasant they found the soil. At length, coming to a large
grove or wilderness full of trees and. hills [perhaps this was
mount Ephraim], from the top of the hill they saw the sea
on the right hand, and little vessels upon it passing to ‚J oppa.
About three or four in the afternoon they came to a ruinous
town called ‘ Bee1·e,' of old (as was reported to them) ⁶ Beer-
sheba,' a great city [but more probably ‘Beeroths mentioned
J osh. xviii. 25]. [t is said, that was the place where Christ's
parents first missed him in their journey, Luke ii. 44. They
would have lodged there that night, being weary and hungry;
and having spent their provision, but they could have nothing
fit for themselves or their horses; and being· from Jerusalem
but ten miles, they went on3 and after having travelled five
01· six miles, had a view of the city. Thus our countryman,
a clergyman, tells us in his book.

This interposition of Samaria between Galilee and -Jndea
must be remembered, when we read the borders and portions
of the tribes set out, Ezek. xlviii3 where Manasseh and
Ephraim (the country of Samaria) are bounded and set out
as formerly, but must not be reckoned under the notion of
Samaria, as they had been.

Necessity itself found, or made a way betwixt J udea and
Galilee through Samaria, because, indeed, there was no
other way they could go, unless a long way about, through
the country beyond J ordan. Nor was there any reason
why they should make any difficulty of going through Sa-
maria, unless the hostility of the country. For,

“ TheX country of the Cuthites is clean.'’ So that with-
out scruple they might gather-of the fruits and products of
it. “ The gatherings of their waters are clean.'’ So that a
J ew might drink, or wash himself in them. ‘⁶ Their dwell-
ings are clean.'’ So that he might enter thereinto, eat or

lodge there. “ Their roads are clean.'' So that the dust of
them did not defile a Jew's feet.
