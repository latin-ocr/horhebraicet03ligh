have spoken largelier upon elsewhere23 from whence it will
be necessary for us to repeat these things ; that there is
0⁸7³ ΠῖἳἾτΔΞ a washiny of the hands, and there is ΞἾἾἾ ΠΒἚΤΔ
a dipping] of the hands. This clause we are upon refers to
this latter. The Pharisee wonders that Christ had not
washed his hands; nay, that he had not dipped them all over
in the water when he was newly come ἐξ ἀγορᾶς, that is, ἐκ
τῶν ὄχλων ἐπαθροιζομένων, ver. 29, fivm the people that were
pathered tlm'ck toyether.

Of how great esteem this waslciny their hands before meat
was amongst them, besides what I have alleged elsewhere,
take this one instance more: ‘⁶ Ita is storied of R. Akibah‚
that he was bound in prison, and R. J oshua ministered unto
him as his ἾΒἻἎΠ, 01· madar. He daily brought him water
by measure. One day the keeper of the prison met him, and
said unto him, ‘Thou hast too much water to-day.’ He
poured out half, and gave him half. When he came to
R. Akibah, he told him the whole matter. R. Akibah saith
unto him, ‘Give me some water to wash my hands ε’ the
other saith unto him, ‘ There is not enough for thee to drink;
and how then shouldest thou have any to wash thine hands 3³
To whom he, ‘ What shall I do in a matter wherein there is
the guilt of death? It is better I should die [that is, by thirst]
than thatI should transgress the mind of my eolleagues :'''
who had thus prescribed about washing of hands.

And a little after3 Samuel saith, ΠῺῙἊΠ ῘΡΠἮ &mvl
0³7³ ΠῙὟἾΔΞἾ ΓΞἾἾἾ) “At that time wherein Salomon insti-
tuted the ‘Erubhin' and washiny os the hands, there came forth
‘Batlz Kol,’ and said, ‘ My son, if thy heart be ivise, even mine
shall rejoice.’ ’⁹ Observe here, (at least if you will believe it‚)
that solomon was the first author of this washing of hands.
‘⁸ Whosoeverb blesseth immediately after the washing of
hands, ΠἾἹὩΒ ΠΠἾΝΞ mmm: ζωΨΠ ΓΝ Satan doch not ac-
cuse kim for tlaat time qf his repast.''
