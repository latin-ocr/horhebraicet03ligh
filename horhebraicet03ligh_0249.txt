(³11. i. 25.] Exercitations upon St. Jolm. 245

The Greek interpretem, instead of ez'ylzt prrbwipal mem
have ὀκτὼ δήγματα ἀυθρώπων, eiyht bitin-qs ‘ff men, a very
foreign sense. They mistook in reading the word ⁸3³0),
for which they read ³:³22).

Hence by how much nearer still the ‘kingdom of heaven‚’
or the expected time of Messiah’s coming, drew on, by so
much the more did they dream of the resurrection of the
prophets. And when any person of more remarkable gravity,
piety‚ and holiness appeared amongst them, they were ready
to conceive of him as a prophet raised from the dead, Matt.
xvi. 14. That therefore is the meaning of this question, ‘O
προφήτης εἶ σύ; “Art thou one of the prophets raised from
the dead.?”

Ver. 2 5: Τί οὖν βαπτίζεις; Why then baptizest ίῇοῑιὲ] The
Jews likewise expected that the world should be renewed at
the coming of the Messiah. “ Inz those years wherein God
will renew his world.” Aruch‚ quoting these words, adds, ⁶³ In
those thousand years,” So also the Gloss upon the place.

Amongst other things, they expected the purifying of the
unclean. R. Solomon upon Ezek. xxxvi. 26 ; “ I will expiate

water of purification.'' Kimchi upon Zech. ix, 6 ; “The
Rabbins of blessed memory have a tradition that Elias will
purify the bastards and restore thern to the congregation.’'
You have the like in Kiclcluslaiffl, *umbi &aab Νι πηπέκ
Elias comes to dsstingyzcislc the maleam and purzfy them, &c

WVhen theref0re they saw the Baptist bring in such an un-
usual rite, by which he admitted the Israelites into a new rule
of religion, they ask him by what authority he doth these
things if he himself were notb either the Messiah or Elias, or
one of the prophets raised from the dead.

It is very well known that they expected the coming of
Elias, and that, from the words of Mal. iv. 5. not rightly un-
derstood. Which mistake the Greek version seems to pa-
t1·onise; Ἀποστελῶ ὑμῖν Ἠλίαν τὸν Θεσβίτην, I will send you,
Elias the Tv'shbite ‚· which word, τὸυ Θεσβίτηυ, they add of
themselves in favour of their own tradition3 which indeed is
too frequent a usage in that version to look so far asquint
