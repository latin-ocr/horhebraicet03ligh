Ver. 43: Ἀγγελος ἐνισχύων αὐτόν· An anyel strenytlzeniny
him] I. In his temptations in the wilderness there was no
angel by him; for St. Matthew saith, chap. iv. 11, “Then the
devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered
unto him :⁵³ that is, not till the devil had first left him. But
in the midst of this trial there was an ‘angel strengthening
him :³ and why so? By reason of his agony, you will say, and
that very truly: but whence arose this agony? and of what
kind was it Ξ It was occasioned (you will say) from a sense of
divine indignation and wrath. This dare not I say or imagine,
that God was angry or conceived any indignation aga-inst him
at all. And if the anguish and agony of his mind was the
result of the divine wrath pressing in upon him, Ι do not see
what kind of comfort an angel could minister against the
wrath of God. It is rather an argument God was not angry
with him, when he sent an angel to comfort him.

II. It is not to be doubted, but that Christ was now
wrestling with a furious enraged devil; yea, a devil loosed
from his chain, and permit-ted, without any check 01· restraint
from divine providence‚ to exert all his force and rage against
him: which was permitted by Orod, not from any displeasure
against his Son, but that even human nature might, by this
her combatant, get a conquest over this insulting enemy. For
it had been a small thing to have vanquished the devil by mere
divine power.

III. However therefore it is not here related in express
terms, yet could I easily persuade myself, that the devil
might at this time appear to our Saviour in some visible
shape. then he temptcd him in the wilderness, he put on
the disguise of some good angel, or rather some kind of re-
semblance of the Holy Ghost. But in this last temptation
he puts on himself, and appears in his own colours3 viz. in
some direful formidable figure, on purpose to terrify our Lord.
And from thence it was that ἤρξατο ἐκθαμβεῖσθαι καὶ ἀδημονεῖν,

and here, γίνεσθαι ἐν ἀγωνίᾳ, to be in an ayony. Nor do I rashly,
and without any ground, suppose this, but upon these reasons :
