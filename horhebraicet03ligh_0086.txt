80 Heln-ew and Talmad-ical [Ch. vi. 1.

nam mmm: that, {f the first day ⁰f tlae feast bappen sin the
middle of the weelss.

His meaning is this: [f the first day of the seven-days? feast
of the Passover happen on the sabbath, then the sheaf being
offered the next day after, the feast of Pentecost will fall on
the next day after the seventh sabbath. But if that first day
happeu in the middle of the week, then, from the offering of
the sheaf the next day, we must not count seven sabbaths but
fifty days.

For instance, suppose we the lamb eaten 011 the third day
of the Jewish week, which with us is Tuesday, Wednesday
was the first day of the feast3 and on Thur-sday the sheaf was
offered 3 then on Thursday again, accounting fifty days, is the
feast of Pentecost. Here seven sabbaths come between, and
four days after the last sabbath, before the Pentecost. W here
numbering by sabbaths shortens the space of tim<33 but num-
bering by fifty days fixes the matter beyond scruple. And at
once it concludes these two things : Ι. 's hat the offering of the
sheaf was not restmined to the next day after the sabbath,
but to the day after the sabbatical day, viz. the first day of
the feast. ΙΙ. That the day of Pentecost was not restrained
to the first day of the week, as the Baithuseans would have it,
but might fall on any day of the week.

What should be the Baithuseans’ reason why they so ear-
nestly contended to reduce the day of Pentecost always to the
morrow after the sabbath, or the first day of the week, is
not easy to eomprehend, Perhaps he that disputes the
matter with Rabban Jochanan gives some hint of it, when
he tells us, “Our master Moses loved IS1ael, and knowing
Ν m* ,ΠἾΒῺΨ that tlte feast of pentecost should be but for one
dags, did therefore appoint it on the morlow afte1 the sabbath,
that Israel might rejoice two days together-2²

Whatever the reason was, it is certain they misunderstood
that phrase DEUH DJT'VD’Q as to the offering the sheaf tlze
morrow after mv& sabbath, when it was to be understood of
the mor] ow astm α sabbatical clay. And so the Greek version,
Και ἀνοίσει τὸ δράγμα ἔναντι Κυρίου ὃεκτὸν ὑμῖν, τῇ ἐπαύριον τῆς
πρώτης· aad ke shall effer the sbeaf before clm Lord to be aocepz‘ecl
for you, on the marrow after tbefirss day os tkefhast.
