teipreted, is Dorcas :²² Beza, Caprea, a ροαί. But what! do
the holy penmen of the Scriptures make lexicons‚ or play the
schoolmasters that they should only teaeh that the Syriae
word Cepha signifies in the Greek language Πέτρα a stone,-
and ΤαόίίΙια, Dorcas, that is, a fleat .? N0; they rather teaeh
what Greek proper names answer to those Syriae proper
names: for the Syriae proper name is here rendered into
the Greek proper name, and not an appellative into an ap-
pellative, nor a proper name into an appellative.

But let the Vulgar have what it desires, and be it so7
‘⁶ Thou shalt be called a rock ;” yet you will scaree grant
that our blessed Saviour should eall Simon α rock in the
direct and most ordinary sense; “ There is no roek save our
God,’' 2 Sam. xxii. 32 : where the Greek interpreters, instead
of ’ἾἾΞ α rock, have κτίστης, the Creator. Which word St. Peter
himself makes use of, 1 Pet. iv. 19, showing who is that rock
indeed.

There ¹¹ is a rech, or ‘ stone of stumbling‚' indeed, as well
as a ‘ foundation-stone3' and this stone of stumbling hath
St. Peter been made, to the fall of many thousands ; not by
any fault of his, but theirs, who, through ignoranee or fro-
wardoess, or both, will esteeln him as a rock upon whieh the
church is built.

lf, therefore, they will so pertinaciously adhere to that
version, Et tto vocaberis Petra, let it be rendered into English
thus, leu wilc be called a rock: and let us apprehend our
blessed Lord speaking prophetieally‚ and foretelling that
grand error that should spring up in the chureh, vix„ that
Peter is a rock, than which the Christian world hath not
known any thing more sad and destructive.

pare it with Isa. lxiii. 8. “I saw thee (saith Christ) when
thou wert under the fig trees* What doing there? Doubt-
less not sleeping, or idling away his time, much less doing
any ill thing. This would not have deserved so remarkable
