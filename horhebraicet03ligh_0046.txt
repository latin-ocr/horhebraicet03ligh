that Simeon died long before, so it is very uncertain whether
he deserved the title of Just as well as our Simeon did.

not well seen in [calluerit] traditions3 or was this very Simeon
the evangelist mentions, and so looked higher than the mere
traditions of men: this is all the hinderanee, that Rabban
Simeon lived a great while aster the birth of our Saviour
and had a son, Gamaliel, whom he bred up a Pharisee.
