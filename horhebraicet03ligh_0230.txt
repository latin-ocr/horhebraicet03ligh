I. The books of the law and their order need not be in-
sisted upon, commonly called by us, the Pentateuclm but by
some of the Rabbins‚ the Heptateuolz,· and by some Christiane,
the Ootateuolz. “ R. Samuel Bar Nachman saithr, R. J onathan
saith, “Wisdom hath hewn out her seven pillars'' [Prov. ix,1].
ΠἾἾΠ ἾἾΞΕ) ΠὨΞΨ ἸΣἾΝ These are the seven books of the law?
“ Thes Book of Numbers eompletes the seven books of the laW.
But are there not but five books only? Ben Kaphra saith,
ΕἾἾΞΒ &17³7ss '³:7³5 ἿἮὩ The Book of Numbers is made
three books. From the beginning of the book to 3250}ss ἿΓῙΓΖᾏ,

And it came to pass when the arlo set forward [chap. X. 35], is

a book by itself. That verse and the following is a book by
itself: and from thence to the end of the book is a book by
itself.”

The reason why they accounted this period [chap. x. 3 5, 36]
to be one book by itself, was partly because it does not seem
put there in its proper place3 partly because in the beginning
of it, it hath the letter Nun inverted thus [C]‚ in the word
ὩἹΞΕΞ, and so, after the end of it, in the word numum,
which in both places is set for a boundary and limit, to
distinguish that period from the rest of the book. What-
ever therefore goes before, from the beginning of the book to
that period, is reckoned by them for one book; and what-
ever follows it, for another book3 and the period itself for a
third.

Eulogiust, speaking concerning Dosthes or Dositheus‚ a
famous seduoer of the Samaritans, hath this passage: Μυρίαις
δὲ καὶ ποικίλαις ἄλλαις υοθείαις τὴν Μωσαῖκὴν Ὀκτάτευχον κατα-
κιβὸηλεύσας, &o He adulterated the Octateuch of ffloses with
spurious writiuya aud all kind of corrupt falsffyz'uys. There is
mention alsou of a book with this title, Χριστιανῶν Βίβλος
Ἑρμηυεία εἰς τὴν Ὀκτάτευχου· T lte Okrz'stiaus’ Book, an Exposi-
tiou upon the octateuolz. Whether this was the Octateuch of
Moses it is neither certain nor much worth our inquiry; for
