not hear himself, he does his duty. But R. J ose would have
it, that he repeats his prayers so that the sound of his own
voice may reach his own ears.'' To this deep silence in the
time of incense and prayers that passage seems to allude,
Rev. viii. 1. 3.

When the incense and prayers were ended, the parts of the
sacrifice were laid upon the altar, and then the Levites began
their psalmody‚ and their sounding the trumpet.

Ver. 11: “ssgbdn δὲ αὐτῷ ἄγγελος Κυρίου· There appeared
mtto him cm aozfyel of the Lora] It might be a reasonable
doubt whether ever there had appeared an angel in the
Temple, even in the first, when elsewhere the appearance of
angels was so very familiar, much less in the second, when
every thing of that nature had so perfectly ceased, till now
that the gospel began to dawn and shine out.

What we find relatedS concerning Simeon the just, how
‘⁶ for those forty years wherein he had served as high priest‚
he had seen an angel clothed in white coming into the Holy
Place on the day of Expiation‚ and going out again: only his
last year he saw him come in, but did not see him go out

solemnity of the day.

the shewbreacl] was on the north side, distant from the wall
two cubits and a half. The candlestick on the south, distant
from the wall two cubits and a half. The altar [of incense]
placed in the middle and drawn out a little towards the
east.''

So that the angel standing on the right side of the altar
stood on the north side: on which side if there were an en-
trance into the Holy of Holies, as R. Chaninah thinks¹1‚ then
we may suppose the angel, by a sudden appearance, came out
from the Holy of Holies.
