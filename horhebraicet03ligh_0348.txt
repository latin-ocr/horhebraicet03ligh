II. It was prohibited amongst them to besmear the eyes
with spittle upon the sabbath day upon any medicinal account,
although it was esteemed so very wholesome for· them.

“ TheyS do not squirt wine into the eyes on the sabbath day,
but they may wash the eyebrows with it: ³³:⁸³2& ‘7²:³³7 ΓΛἾἸ
ww& ΓὩΠ Ξλ ζῖζυ but as to fastiny spz'ttle” [which was es-
teemed exceedingly wholesome} “it is not Zawfal to put it so
much as upon the eyelsidsf' “ Onet saith, that wine is prohibited
so sar that it may not be injected into the middle of the eyes;
upon the eyebrows it may. Another saith that spittle is for-
bidden so much as upon the eyelids.'’

So that in this action of our Saviour's we may observe,

Ι. That he does not heal this sick man with a word, as he
did others3 but chooseth to do a thing which was against
their canonical observation of the sabbath; designing thereby
to make a trial of the inan, whether he was so superstitious,
that he would not admit such things to be done upon him on
the sabbath day. He made an experiment not much unlike
this upon the man at Bethesda, as we have before observed.

II. Whiles he mingles spz'ttle with dust, and of that
makes a clay to anoint the eyes of the blind man, he thereby
avoideth the suspicion of using any kind of charm, and gives
rather a demonstration of his own divine power, when he heals
by a method contrary to nature3 for clay laid upon the eyes,
we might believe, should rather put out the eyes of one that
seeS, than restore sight to one that had been blind. Yea and
further, he gave demonstration of the divine authority he
himself had over the sabbath, when he heals upon that day
by the use of means which had been peculiarly prohibited to
be used in it.

The connexion of this chapter with the former is such,
that the stories in both seem to have been acted on one and
the same day. [Διελθὼυ διὰ μέσου αὐτῶν· καὶ παρῆγεν οὕτως,

εἶδεν ἄνθρωποι) τυφλόν, And as he passed bys. lm saw α man
which was blind] If it be so, (which Ι will not much contend
about,) then dou they bring the adulterous woman before
Christ, yea, and attempt to stone him too, on the sabbath
