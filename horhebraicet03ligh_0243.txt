VEB. 1: Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἢν 6 Λόγος· In the beyimzzny was the W ord ]
Ἐν ἀρχῇ In the beyimziny; in the same sense with nfftan

Bereslzitlc, In the beyimziuy, in the history of the eleation, Gen.
i. 1. For the evangelist pl oposeth this to himself viz. to shew
how that, by the lVord, by which the oreation was perfected,
the redemption was perfeoted also: That the second person
in the holy Trinity, in the fulness of time, became our Re-
deemer, as in the beginning of time he had been our Maker.
Compare this with ver. 14:

Θεὸς ἧν ὁ Λόγος. Ἐγένετο σὰρξ, καὶ ἐθεασάμεθα, ἀρ.
The W ord was God. Was madefieslz,aml we belaeld‚&c.

ῗΗν 6 λόγος· Was the Word] There is no great necessity
for us to make any very curious inquiry, whence our evangelist
should borrow this title, when in the history of the creation

we find it so often repeated, ΕῬΠῙῬΝ Ἶ79ΝἿ] And God said.
