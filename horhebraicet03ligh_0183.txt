VEB. 2: Εἰ μύλος ὀνικὸς περίκειται περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ’
ΤΙιατ a millstone were Izan-9665 about leis neck] There is men-
tion among the Talmudic authors, concerning ἴτω [1³³er
5523·ss om ass-mill, and it is distinguished from a haud-mill.
“ Whosou hireth a house of his neighbour, ΞἾἿΠἾ U ''Wssym
ἾἾὮΠ ζῖζῃ ke may build an ass-mill, ἾἾ ῑῗῖῃ ΕἫΠἾ ΝῙῬ 372&
but not a leand-mill.”

To have a millstone haozyed about ln's neck was a common
proverb. “ SamuelX saith, It is a tradition, that a man may
marry, and after that apply himself to the study of the law.
But R. J ochanan saith, No. ΠἻἾΠΞ moyn ἾἾδὲἾΞΞ nni-tw
Skall he addict himself to the stuc& qu‘lee law with α millstom
about his neck ? ''

Suidas tells us, “Ore κατεπόντουι) τινὰς, λίθους ἀπὸ τῶν τρα-
χήλων ἀπεκρέμαζοι)’ wlcan they drowned any «ἱη tlze sea, they
kuozy stones about their neck-s. And quotes that of Aristo—
phanes:

’Άρας μετέωρον εἷς τὸ βάραθρον ἐμβαλῶ,
Ἐκ τοῦ λάρυγγος ἐκκρεμάσας Ὑπέρβολον.
Equites: 1361. [Brunck]

Lifting him up, I'll plunge him to the deep,
A stone hung at his neck.

For so suidas takes ὑπέρβολον, and renders it by λίθου, a
stone. But his interpreter ingeniously remarks, that Suidas
seems to have reached the place and meaning of the poet;
for ὑπέρβολος signifies not a stone hung about the neck of him
that is to be drowned in the sea3 but when he should have
said λίθου ἐκκρεμάσας, Izanyiny a stone, he does by way of jest,
and beside all expectation, for laughter’s sake, say, ἐκκρεμά-
σας Ὑπέρβολον, hanyinq Hyperbolus, that is, a Zz'tiyious fellow,
about his neck, whom, for his peculiar wickedness, he would
represent as the most burdensome thing that could be to all
the Athenians, hanging about them like a heavy stone that
is hanged about the neck of one condemned to be drowned ς
one, indeed, that deserves that fate himself, that he might no
more vex and disturb the commonwealth. ’
