Ch. iv. 25] [aleercimtions upon St. Luke. 753
for three years together, is evident enough from 1 Kings xvii,
&ez but whence comes this addition of sioe months ,9

“Elijwh said to Ahab, As the Lord God of Israel liveth,
before whom I stand there shall not be dew nor rain these
yeais‚ but according to my word31'7l7N1-'l D‘ffilyffl' ΠἾΠἾ 0 §3

at the least, because he saith 0²¹⁴: 1171961113 in the plural, and

not ΞἾΠΞζζ] yems in the daal.

And ch 111 xviii. ‘The wmd of the Lord came to Elijah in
the thiid y,ear saying, (110 shew thyself unto Ahab, and I will
send rain upon the earth.’' In the third year,· where then
shall we find the six months .9

I. Doubtless both our Saviour and his apostle St. Jamesz.
chap. v. ver 17, in adding six months do speak according to
the known and received opinion of that nation3 which is also
done elsewhere sometimes in historical matters in the New

Testament.

St. Stephen tells us, Acts vii. 16, that the bones of the
*twelve patriarchs were carried over from Egypt and buried
in Sychem, when hely writ mentions only the. bones and burial
of J oseph: wherein he speaks according 10 1116 vulgar opinion
¹ of the natione.

Again, ver. 30, he tells us that Moses was forty years old
when he flesl into the land of Midian, and that he tarried
there forty years more, when Moses himself mentions ‘nothing
of this circumstance: this 116 speaks agreeably 10 1116 opinion
of that peoplef.

II. Neither our Saviour nor St.Jarnes says that Elijah shut
up 1116 heavens three years and six months3 but Christ tells
us, ‘⁶ That the heaven was shut up in the days of Elias three
years and six months :⁹⁹ and St. J ameS‚ “ That Elias prayed
that- 11 might not rain, and it rained not upon the earth by
the space of three years and six months.''

May Ι therefore have leave 10 distinguish in this manner?
Elijah shut up the heaven for three years, that there might
be no rain, as in the Book of Kings: and there was no rain
for three years and a half, as 0111· Saviour and St. James
relate.
