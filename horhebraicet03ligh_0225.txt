different from the form of a yardener, and indeed not the
form of any plebeian3 but rather of some scholar, because he
instructs them while they were upon the road, and giveth
thanks for them when they sat at meat. So Beracothd‚· “ If
twoe eat together, the one of them amo a learned man, the
other of them 'rm cm unlearned mari, he that is the learned
man gives thanks.” Hence that passages: “ J anneus the king

drim, and a doctor, to say grace after supper: and thus he

his guests have eaten.' To whon] the king, ‘ How long wilt
thou persist in thy frowardness ?' Saith the other, ‘Why‚ what

been miraculously accomplished, as their first redemption
from Egypt had been.

day, Gen. xxii. 4. It is written, After two days will he revive
us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in

his sight. Hos vi. 2. It is written, concerning the third day
of the tribes, ,Ioseph said unto them, The third day, Gen.
xlii. 18. Ooncerning the third daps also of the spies: Hide
yourselves there three days, J osh. ii. 16. And it is said of
the third day of the promulgation of the law, And it carne to
pass on the third day, Exod. xix, 16. It is written also of
the third day of Jonas, Jonas was in the belly of the fish three
days and three nights‚ J onah i. 17. It is written also of the
third day of those that came up out of the captivity, And
