osche just] The Greek in Malachi hath it, καρδίαν ἀνθρώπου
πρὸς τὸυ πλησίου αὐτοῦ, the beart of a man towards his 92673ρᾶ-
bour. The words of the prophet having been varied, the
angel varies too, but to a more proper sense. For the Gen-
tiles were not to be turned to the Jews as such, or to the
religion of the Jews, but to God “ in the wisdom of the just.''
“ The children to the fathers :²³ the phrase fathers, according
to the J ewish state at that time, was of doubtful sound, and
had something of danger in it3 for by that word generally
at that time, was meant nothing else but the Fathers of
Traditions, to whom God forbid any should be turned to
those fathers in the folly of traditions, but to God in the
wisdom of the just.

If so old α man, why then was he not sequestered from the
service of the Temple by the law of superannuation? Numb.
iv. 3 ; viii. 24, 2 5. Hear what the Rabbins say in this case:

“ ThereC is something that is lawful in the priests that
is unlawful in the Levites: and there is something lawful in ·
the Levites, that is unlawful in the priests. The Rabbins
deliver3 the priests upon any blemish are unfit3 as for their
years they are not unfit 3 the Levites for their years may be
unfit, but by reason of blemish are not. From that which is
said, that at the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting,
we learn that years may make the Levites unfit. Perhaps
the priests also are made unfit through years: and indeed,
does it not seem in equity, that if the Levites, whom a ble-
mish doth not make unfit, should yet be made unfit by super-
annuation, should not much more the priests be made unfit
by superannuation, when even a spot or blemish will make
them unfit? But the text saith, This is the law of the Le—
vites; not, This is the law of the priests. The Rabbins
deliver: What time a priest comes to maturity, till he grow
old, he is fit to minister3 and yet a spot or blemish makes
him unfit. The Levite from his thirtieth to his fiftieth year
is fit for service ; but being superannuated, he becomes unfit.
How must this be understood concerning the Levites? Το
wit, for that time wherein the ark was in the wilderness : but
