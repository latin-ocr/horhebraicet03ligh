302 Hebrew <md Talmudical [Ch. vi. 9, 12.

“a-‚3535 ³:³52 ³7: ζΠ Ἶζῗθὶ, These are all the business-es
of τὴν publio .· they judged all pecuniary faults, those also that
were capital, and those for which the offenders were soourged.
They redeemed devoted things3 they made the suspected
wife drink3 they burnt the red heifer; they bored the ear of
the Hebrew servant; they cleansed the lepers, and removed
the covers from the well‚'' that every one might be at liberty
to drink.

The Gloss is, ‘⁶ And some that were deputed in that affair
went abroad to see if the fields were sown with corn, and the
vineyards planted with heterogeneous trees.'’

Ver. 9: Πέντε ἄρτους κριθίνους· Five barlay Zoaves] Gom-
pare 2 Kings iv. 42, and see Olietubss: where the masters
enhance the number of men fed by Elisha to two thousand
two hundred. 187³& UND *Dp ‘'w-n ἻΠ ³72 ‘⁶ Every hundred
men had their single loaf set before them.'' The Gloss is,
“ Twenty leaves and the loaf of the first fruits, behold one-
and-twenty3 ‘mun the (sreen ear, behold two-and-twenty:
these were all singly set, each of them before a hundred
men; and so behold there¹ were two thousand and two hun-
dred fed.” By the same proporfflon, in our Saviour’s mira-
culous feeding the people‚ one single loaf must serve for a
thousand.

Ver. 12: Τὰ περισσεύσαντα κλάσματα· lee fluyments that
remam] It was a custom and rule, that when they ate to-
gether, they should leave something to those that served:
which remnant was called UND peak. And it is remarked
upon R. J oshua‚ that, upon a journey, having something pro-
vided for him by a hospitable widow, he ate all up, and left
nothing to her that ministeredm. Where the Gloss : “ Every
one leaves Πδὲἰ), α little portion in the dish, and gives it to
those that serve; which is called the servitor’s part.''

Although Ῑ would not confound the περισσεύσαντα κλάσματα
with the ΠΝΞ, nor would affirm that what was left was in
observation of this rule and onstom3 yet we may observe,
that the twelve baskets'full offra-ommate left at this time an-
swered to the number of the twelve apostles that ministered.
It is otherwise elsewhere.
