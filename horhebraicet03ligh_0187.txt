Ver. 20: Οὐκ ἔρχεται ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ μετὰ παρατηρή-
σεως· The kioz‘csdom of Gocl comem not with observatiam] T lm
kinqdom of God, or of heaven, hath especially a twofold dis-
tinct sense in the Holy Scriptures. In some places it sig·
nifies the propagation of the gospel by the Messias and his
followers, and that especially amongst the Gentiles: in other
places it denotes the Messiah’s victory and vengeance upon
the Jews, the enemies of this gospel3 but in the Jewish
schools this was their conceit of him: that when he came
he should cut off all those nations that obeyed not his, i. e.
the· Jewish law; redeeming Israel from the Gentile yoke3
establishing a kingdom and age amongst them that should
be crowned with all kind of delights whatever. In this they
were miserably deceived, that they thought the Gentiles were
first to be destroyed by him, and then that he himself would
reign amongst the Israelites. Which, in truth, fell out just
contrary3 he was first to overthrowlsrael, and then to reign
amongst the Gentiles.

It is easy to conceive in what sense the Pharisees pro-
pounded that question, lVlzen {1⁷26 kinydom of God should
come? that is, when all those glorious things should be ac-
complished which they expected from the Messias? and,
consequently, we may as well conceive, from the contexture
of his discourse, in what sense our Saviour made his reply:
“You inquire when the Messias will come: His coming
will beh as in the days of Noah, and as in the days of Lot.
For as when Noah entered the ark the world perished by a
deluge, and as when Lot went out of Sodom those five cities
were overthrown, ‘ so shall it be in the day when the Son of
Man shall be revealed.' ’⁷ So that it is evident he speaks of
the kingdom of God in that sense, as it signifies that dreadful
revenge he would ere long take of that provoking nation
and city of the Jews. The kingdom of God will come when
Jerusalem shall be made like Soclom, ver. 29, when it shall be
made a caroase, ver. 37.
