strength to the utmost of what 116 either could or would, be-
cause 116 knew his champion Christ was strong enough, not
only to bear his assaults, but to overcome them.

ΙΙΙ. Η6 was to overcome, not by his divine power, for how
easy a matter were it for an omnipotent God to conquer the
most potent created being; but his victory must be obtained
by his obedience, his righteousness, his holiness.

IV. Here then was the rise of that trouble and agony of
Ghrist's soul, that he was presently to grapple'with the utmost
rage of the devil3 the divine power in the mean time sus-

with those weapons of obedience and righteousness only.

It was about this, therefore, that that petition of our
Saviour and the answer from heaven was concerned: which
may be gathered from what follows, ver. 31, “ Now shall the
prince of this world be cast out.''

“Now is my soul troubled (saith he), and what shall Ι

wouldst glorify thy name, thy promise, thy decree, against
the devil, lest he should boast and insult.''

The answer from heaven to this prayer is, “ I have already
glorified my name in that victory thou formerly obtainedst
over his temptations in the wilderness; and I will glorify
my name again in the victory thou shalt have in this combat
also.''

Luke iv. 133 “ When the devil had ended all the tempta-
tion, he departed from him for a season.” He went away
baffied then: butZ now he returns more insolent, and much
more to be conquered.

And thus now, the third time, by a witness and voice from
heaven, was the Messiah honoured according to his kingly
office ς as he had been according to his priestly office when
he entered upon his ministry at his baptism, Matt. iii. 173
and according to his prophetic office when he was declared to
be he that was to be heard, Matt. xvii. 5, compared with
Dent. xviii. ¹5·
