and benefit should not want some notable prognostic and
forerunner. And therefore, amongst all the fount-ains and
pools that were in Jerusalem for washing the unclean, he
chose the most noble and celebrated pool of Bethesda, οι·
Siloam, that in that might appear some prefiguration of his
blood that should heal the world. Those waters, therefore, that
had been only cleansing before, were made healing now; that,
by their purifying and healing quality, they might prefigure
and proclaim that that true and living Fountain was not far
off, who should both purge and hcal mankind in the highest
degree.

How many years before our Saviour’s suffering this mi-
raculous virtue of the pool discovered itself, the holy story
doth not tell us: and as for the traditional books, I do not
find that they once mention the thing, although I have turned
over not- a few of their writings (if possible) to have met with
it. From what epocha, therefore, to date the beginning of

earthquake in Judea, that made an infinite slaughter of
beasts in that country; and near ten thousand people slain
by the fall of housesr· Perhaps in that ruin the tower of
Siloam fell, of which Luke xiii. 43 and what if then the angel
made his descent first into the pool? as Matt. xxviii. 2,
“There was a great earthquake, for the angel of the Lord
desce11ded,” Sic. But in this matter I had rather learn than
dogmatize.

It¹¹ might be further inquired, at what time it was first
known that the healing quality followed the troubling of the
waters; bnt this is as dark and obscure as the former:
