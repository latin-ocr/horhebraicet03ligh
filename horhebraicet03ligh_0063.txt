Ch. iii. 36.] Eaearcitatz'ons upon St. Lake. 57

1. Ι cannot be persuaded by any arguments that this
passage concerning Cainan was in Moses's text, or indeed
in any Hebrew copies which the Seventy used3 but that it
was certainly added by the interpreters themselves, partly
because no reason can be given how it should ever come to
be left out of the Hebrew text, and partly because there
may be a probable reason given why it should be added in
the Greek3 especially when nothing was more usual with
them than to add of their own, according to their own will
and pleasure.

Huic uni forsan poteram succumbere culpae.

I might, perhaps, acknowledge this one slip, and be apt
to believe that Cainan had once a place in the original, but,
by I know not what fate or misfortune, left now out; but that
I find a hundred such kind of additions in the Greek version,
which the Hebrew text will by no means own, nor any pro-
bable reason given to bear with it. Let us take our instances
only from proper names, because our business at present is
with a proper name.

Gen) x· 2 : -Ἐλισὰ, Elisa is added among the sons of
Japhet: and, ver. 22, Καϊνὰν, another German among the
sons of Shem.

Gen. xlvi. 20: Five grandchildren added to the sons of
Joseph3 Mal. iv. 5, the Tishbite. [ῬΙλίαυ τὸν Θεσβίτηυ]

Exod. i. ι] : '‘D-v, the city On, is added to Pithoni and
R-aamses.

2 Sam. XX. 18: the city Dom is added to Abel. Not
to mention several other names of places in the Book of
Joshua.

Now can I believe that these names ever were in the
Hebrew copy, since some of them are put there without
any reason, some of them ayaiwst all reason (particularly Dan
being joined with Abel, and the grandchildren of J oseph),
and all of them with no foundation at all?

ΙΙ. I question not but the interpreters, whoever they were,
engaged themselves in this undertaking with something of a
partial mind ς and as they made no great conscience of
iinposing upon the Gentiles, so they made it their religion
