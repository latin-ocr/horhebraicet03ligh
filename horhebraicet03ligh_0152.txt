146 Hebrew mul Talmudieal [Oh. ’dii-35·

shall never see the consolations of Messiah, nor have me any
ways propitious amongst you, endeavouring at all the preser-
vation of your city or nation from ruin, till ye shall say,
‘ Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.' ’²

II. But then here ariseth as great a difficulty about the
word ἕως, wll,- that is, whether it concludes that in time they
will say and acknowledge it3 or whether it excludes and
denies that they ever shall. For who knows not how dif-
ferent and even contrary a force there is in this word until ,9
“Occupy till I comet :'’ here it concludes that he will come
again. “ This iniquity shall not be forgiven you till you dieu :⁹²
there their forgiveness is excluded for ever. And indeed the
expression in this place looks so perfectly two ways, that he
that believes the conversion of the Jewish nation as a thing
must come to pass, may turn it to his side ; he that believes
the contrary, to his.

Εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου· Blessed is Ῐιθ that

weighing of these words will not very much help in determin-
ing the force of this word mztil in this place, yet will it pro—
bably afford us some light into the whole clause.

in the Great Hallel. So that Ι will beg the reader’s leave to
digress a little in search of this usage, especially as to those
words that are now in hand.

I. The Great Hallel was the recitation of Psalms cxiii,
cxiv, cxv, cxvi, cxvii, cxviii, upon every feast, in every family
01· brotherhood, [φρατρία.] The hymn that our Saviour wit-h
his apostles sung at the close of the Passover wasX the latter
part of this Hallel.

ΙΙ. Every one, indeed, was of right bound to repeat it
entirely in his own person. But seeing it was not every one's
lot to be so learned or expedite as that came to, there was
one to recite it in the stead of all the rest, and they after
him made some responsals. This went for a maxim amongst
them, ΠΠἾὩΒ rmum if lm hear, it is as ff ke responded. ΕΝ
