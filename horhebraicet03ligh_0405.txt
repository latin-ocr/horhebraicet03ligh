false and ridiculous legend, that “ the law of Moses is truth.''
But the Jews might (if they would) attain to a much more
sonnd way of jndging concerning the truth of it, and consider
that the law is not the sum and ultimate of all truth‚ but that
Christ is the very truth of the trnth of Moses: John i. 17,
‘⁶ The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came
(ἐγένετο) by Jesus Christ.”

Ver. 7: Εἰ ἐγυώκειτέ με, 816. Ifftse laad known me, &0ss It
was a very difficnlt thing to spell out the knowledge of the
Messiah from the law and the prophets under the first
Temple 3 but it was doubly more difficult under the second.
For, under the first Temple, Moses had only his own veil over
him, and the prophets only their own proper and original
obscurity: but under the second Temple, the obscurity is
doubled by the darkness and smoke of traditions3 which had
not only beclouded the true doctrines of saith and religion,
but had also brought in other doctrines diametrically contrary
to the chief and principal articles of saith ε 111066 for instance
concerning justificationO, the person, reign, and office of the
Messiah‚ &Q

With what measures of darkness these mists of tradition
had covered the minds of the apostles, it is both diffie-ult, and
might be presumptuous, to determine. They did indeed own
Jesus for the true Messiah, John i. 41 3 Matt. xvi, 16 : but if
in some things they judged amiss concerning his office, under-
taking, and government, we must put it upon the score of
that epidemical distemper of the whole nation which they
still did in some measure labour under. And to this may
this clause have some reference, “ If ye had known me, and
had judged aright concerning the office, undertaking, and au-
thority of the Messiah, ye would, in all these things which I
teach and do, have known the will, command, and authority
of the Father.''

Καὶ ἆπ” ἄρτι γινώσκετε αὐτόν· And from bencefortlb ye know
him] We may render it, Henoeforward therefore know him.-
“ Henceforward acknowledge the Father in all that I have
done, brought in, and am to introduce still, and set your
hearts to rest in it ε believing that you see the Father in me,
and in the things that Ι (10.”
