ίΙιθ dead bury their dead] The Jews accounted of the Gren-
tiles as no other than dead. ΕΓἺἻε ῙΞἫ mini-257 Ἴδῃ the
people of the earth, [that is, tlze Gentilem do not live. And as
the Gentiles, so even amongst themselves, these four sorts
are so esteemed: Dinnjf '‘³2wa 327 3725& “ These fimr
are accounted as dead, the blind, the leprous, the poor, and

the ehildless.''

Vm. 1 ε Ἑβδομήκοντα· δευθηΐμ] Why the Vulgar should
have seventy-and-two, they themselves, I suppose, are able to
give no very good reason: much less the interpreter of Titus
Bostrensis, when in the Greek copy before him he saw only
ἑβδομήκοντα, why he should render it septuayinta duos,
severity-two.

Aben Ezra upon the storys of Eldad and Medad hath this
passage: “The wise men say, That Moses took six out of
every tribe, and the whole number amounted to seventy-and-
two: but whereas the Lord had commanded only seventy,
the odd two were laid aside.'' Now if God laid aside two of
those who had been enrolled, and endowed with the Holy
spirit, thath so there might be the just number of seventy
only, we ean hardly imagine why our Saviour should add
two, to make it seventy-two and not severity. “ Iti. was said
to Moses at Mount Sinai, Go up, thou and Aaron, and Nadab
and Abihu, and seventy of the elder-s of Israel: so will the
holy blessed God ordain to himself in the world to come
'bum 0⁶00ss lviv mmm* a cozmcz'l of elders of his own people.''
Now the number of this consistory, the doctors determine to
be no other than seventy. A couneil of seveozty-two was never
heard of amongst the Jews, but once only at J abneh.

“ R. Simeonk Ben Azzai saith, ΕὋΡἚ ΕΗΒ) ‘'ff-'m ³2& ³7:2in
I received it from the mouths of tlte severzty-two elders, on the
day when they made R. Eliezer Ben Azariah one of the San-
hedrim.” Nor did they then remove Rabban Gamaliel, al-
though he had displeased them. ’
