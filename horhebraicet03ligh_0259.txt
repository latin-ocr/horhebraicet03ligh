sense, viz: This was the manner of the ›S'lcoshbenutſtr some
bacheler or single person, for joy of his friend⁵s marriage,
takes something along with him to eat and be merry with
the bridegroom: when it comes to the turn of this single
person to marry, this bridegroom, to whom he had brought
this portion, is bound to return the same kindness again.
Nay, if the father should make a wedding for his son, and his
friends should bring gifts along with them in honour of the
nuptials‚ and give them‘to his son [the bridegroom], the
father was bound to return the same kindness whenever any
of those friends should think fit to marry themselves. But
if any one should send the bridegroom to congratulate his
nuptiaIS‚ either wine or oil, or any such gift, and not come
himself to eat and make mei-ry with them, this was not of the
nature of the Slmslabenuth, nor could be required back again
before the tribunal, because that was a free gift.

IV. Christ therefore, and five of his disciples, were not of
these voluntary Shoslzbem‘n at this wedding, for they were in-
vinted guestS, and so of the number of those that were called
the ΠΞἿΠ *32 children of the brideclcamber, distinguished
from the Shoslcbem'n. But whether our Saviour's mother was
to be accounted either the one or the other is a vain and
needless question. Perhaps she had the care of preparing
and managing the necessaries for the wedding, as having some
relation either with the bridegroom or the bride.

The number of the six waterpots, I suppose, needs not be
ascribed to any custom of the nation, but rather to the mul-¹
titude then present. It is true indeed that at nuptials and
other feasts, there were waterpots always set for the guests to
wash their hands at; but the number of the vessels and the
quantity of water was always proportioned according to the
