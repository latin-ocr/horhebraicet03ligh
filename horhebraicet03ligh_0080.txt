III. The words of Menander in J osephus may help a little
towards the untying this knot: Μέμνηταιὲ δὲ τῆς ἀνομβρίας
ταύτης καὶ Μέυαυὸρος ἐι) ταῖς Ἰθοβάλου τοῦ Τυρίων βασίλεως
πράξεσι, λέγων οὕτως· Ἀβροχία τε ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο, ἀπὸ τοῦ
(Ὑπερβερεταίου μηνὸς ἕως τοῦ ἐχομένου ἔτους εὙπερβερεταίου. Me-
nander also makes mention of this drozcykt in the acts of Itho-
ὂαίας, kiny οἵ Tyra, sayiny, There was no rain from the month
of October to the month of October the yearfollozoiny.

Ith is true he shortens the space of this drought by making
it continue but one ματη· but however, having placed the be-
ginning of it in the month of October, he gives us a key that
opens us a way into things more inwaid and secret.

IV. Consider the distinction of tlte former and the latter

rain, ἱζῆρῖξζὶἾ rm* Deut xi. 14; Jer. v. 24; QJoel1i. 23.

((·Τιιο Rabbins deliver: 30³:27 unffi-vm pin-mm mr·

Nisan.''

The Targumist in J oel ii. 23: “Who hath given you the

first rain in season 30⁸2 ΠἾἮ ΝΨᾪΒὈἾ ancl the latter in the
month Nisan.'' See also our note upon chap. ii. 8.

R. Solomon‚ upon Deut. xi, differs a little; but we are not
solicitous about the order, which should be the first, either
that in the month Marchesvan, or that in the month Nisan :
that which makes to our purpose is, that rains were at those
stated times 3 and for the rest of the year generally there was
no rain.

V. Those six months mentioned by our Saviour and St.
J ames must be accounted before the beginning of the three
years, and not tacked to the end of them, as is very evident
from this, that it is said, “ The third year Elijah shewed him-
self to Ahab,” 810.

In the beginning therefore of those three years we believe
Elijah shut up heaven upon the approach of that time wherein
the rains were wont to fall in the month of Marohesvan, and
opened heaven again the same month at the end of three
years. Nor is it nothing that Menander speaks of the ἀβροχία,
the drouyht, taking its beginning in the month October, which
