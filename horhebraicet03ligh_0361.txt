manded that every house should set up at least one, let· the
inhabitants there be more or one only. But he that does
honour to the command sets up his candles according to the
number of the persons that are in the house. And he again
that does more honour to it still sets up one candle for every
person in the house the first night d, and doubles it the second
night. For example, if there be ten persons 111 the house,
the first night there are ten candles lighted ; the second night,

It would be too tedious to transcribe what he relates about
singing 1116 Hallel upon that feast: the place where the candle
