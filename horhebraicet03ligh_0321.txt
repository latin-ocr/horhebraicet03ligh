Ver. ¹9² Τί με ζητεῖτε &mxv-eham Why ρο ye about to
hill me?] 'she emphasis or force of this clause lies chiefly
in the word me: ‘⁴ Why go you about to kill me? none os
you all perform the law as you ought; and yet your great
design is to kill ww, as a transgressor of it: why me, and not
others Γ

But as to this matter, they distinguish in Ber-eskitlah Babba .·
‘⁶ Jacob of Nabor taught thus in Tsur: 37:12 3752ss ἾΓιἾΌ
nam: nrm] ἶῒῖζ), It 'is lawful to circumcise 1¹]ae son qf a
strcm‘qer on tlte sabbath day. R. Haggai heard this, and sent
to him saying, *19³7 Nn, Come ancl be disciplined [vapula]‚'’
&c. And a little after3 “ R. Haggai saith to him, ,ὩἮἾ

you. If a heathen come to you, and say, I would be made a
J ew, so that he would be circumcised on 1116 sabbath day, or*
on the day of Expiation, will we, for his sake, profane those

Expiati0n‚ for any other than one born of an Israelitess only {³⁹
We meet with the same also in Bemiclbar Rabbai, and Illidras
Oobeletlz k.

Let us look a little into the way os Christ-'s arguing in
this place: to me it seems thus: “ Moses, therefore, gave
you circumcision, that you might rightly understand the na-
ture of the sabbath: for, Ι. Circumcision was to be observed
by the fathers before Moses, punctually on the eighth day.
II. Now, therefore, when Moses established the laws about
the sabbath, he did by no means forbid the work of eircum-
6ἰείοη 011 1116 sabbath, if it happened to be the eighth day.
