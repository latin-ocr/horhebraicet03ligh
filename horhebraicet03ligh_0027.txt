than a converter. For whence can we better darive the ety-
mology? to which indeed the prophet Malachi seems to have
alluded‚ “ssehold, I send you Elijah the prophet, Ξηζὲζῐᾎ and

loe shall turn,'’ &c.

V. Butb be it so that he might be called Tishbite from the
city Toshab, as the Targum and other Rabbins would have it
(which yet is very farfetched), that very thing might evince
that it is not he himself that is meant by Malachi, but some
other, because he doth not mention the Tischtc, but a prophet
Elias, that is, a pmphet in the spirit qf Elias.

So among the Talmudists‚ any one skilled in signs and
languages is called Mordecai, viz. because he is like him who
lived in the days of Ahasuerusc.

Ἐπιστρέψαι καρδίας πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα· To turn the hedris of
tho fathers to the children] John came ἐυ δυνάμει, in thepower
of Elias3 not that power by which he wrought miracles [for
John wrought none, John x. 41]; but “in the power of Elias
turning the hearts of men‚'' Sto. Elias turned many of the
children of Israel towards the Lord their God, 1 Kings xviii :
so did John, who over and above “turned the hearts of the
fathers towards their children.” Which what it should mean
is something dark and unintelligible. You will hardly allow
the Jews’ gloss upon this place, who do so greatly mistake
about the person, and who will allow nothing of good to be
done by the Elias they expect, but within the compass of
Israel. But are not the Gentiles to be convertedZ They in
the prophets' dialect are ‘the children of Zion, of Jerusalem,
of the Jewish church ε’ nothing more frequent. And in this
sense are the words of Malachi we are now handling to be
understood: ‘Elias the Baptist will turn the hearts of the
Jews towards the Gentiles, and of the Gentiles towards the
J ews.' This was indeed the great work of the gospel, to bring
over the J ew and Gentile into mutual embraces through the
acknowledgment of Christ: which John most happily began,
who came that “all men through him might believe,” John
i. 7: yea, and the Roman soldiers did believe as well as the
Jews, Luke iii. ¹4·
