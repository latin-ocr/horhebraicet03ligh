Vna. 1 : Περὶ τῶν Γαλιλαίων· Oftlw Galileoms] If this report
concerning the Galileans was brought to our Saviour immedi-
ately after the deed was done, then was this tragedy acted by
Pilate, a little before the feast of Dedication3 for we find
Christ going towards that feast, ver. 22. But the time of this
slaughter is uncertain: for it is a question, whether they that
tell him this passage [rem], relate it as news which he had not
heard before, 01· only to draw from him his opinion concerning

will not contend it), then do these, who tell this to our Sa-
viour, seem to lay a snare for him, not much unlike that
question they put to him, “ Is it lawful to give tribute to
Caesar, or no 3''

ΙΙ. There is one that confounds this story with that of

“ In Galilee there were certain Samaritam, who, being se-
duced by a notorious impostor, moved sedition at mount
Gerizim, where this cheat promised them to shew them the
sacred vessels which, he falsely told them, had been hid by
Moses in that place. Pilate, sending his forces upon them,
