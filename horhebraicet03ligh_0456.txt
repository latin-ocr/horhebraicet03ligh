as the Syriac3 or ΝῬἾἾἼ, or &⁸323 it seems to be a very
familiar and gentle compellation‚ that his disciples, fromthat
very salutation of his, might discern him. They did not know
him by sight, as appears, ver. 4: he would have them know
him, therefore, by the title he gave them.

Προσφάγιου· Any meat] ΠἾἾὩῦέ Diffi, which is very usual
amongst the Rabbins, may not unfitly be renderedc προσφά-
γιον, 1. 6. meat for one sinyle repast: as if Christ should have
said, “ Children‚ have ye anyd meat with you sufficient for a
breakfast or a dinner3’' But if προσφάγιον should signify any
sort of meat that must be eatan with bread, as Camerarius

thinks, then Christ's words seem to have this meaning: ”

these ,9 If thou thinkest thou art providede, and canst hazard
thy life for me, feed my sheep; and for my sake do thou
expose thy life, yea, and lay it down for them.'’
