Instances of this kind are endless. But it isl disputed
upon what foundation this constitution of theirs is built.
“ W hencem eomes it to be thus ordained concerning the

this, ‘ Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day,' '²
Exod. xvi. 29. “ Wheren are these two thousand cubits
mentioned 3 they have their tradition from hence, ω’*ζξὶ ἣΠ-ἶζῧ
Ῥξῖῖᾞῇ Abide με every man ἐπ leis place, Exod. xvi. 29. These-
are four cubits. Let no man go out of his place: these are
two thousand cubits.” It is true, indeed, we cannot gain so
much as one cubit out of any of these Scriptures‚ much less
two thousand3 however, we may learn from hence the plea—
sant art they have of working any thing out of any thing.

“ Asai Ben Akibah saith, ‘They are {fetched from hence:
in that it is said, Uisa] ΟᾫὮ Place, place. Here place is
said [Let no man go out of his place} And it is said else-
where, I will appoint thee a place, Exod. xxi. 13. As the
place that is said elsewhere is two thousand cubits, so the
place that is spoken of here is two thousand cubits.'' But
how do they prove that the place mentioned elsewhere is
two thousand cubits3 “ Ι0 will appoint thee a place whither
he shall flee that kills a man unawares ε this teaches us that
the Israelites in the wilde1·ness'’ (i. e. those that had slain
any one) “ betook themselves to a place of refuge. And
whither did they fiee? To the camp of the Levites.'’

Now, therefore, when the Israelites’ camp in the wilder-
ness was distant from the tabernacle and from the Levites’
camp that was pitched about the tabernacle, two thousand
cubits‚ which thing they gather from J osh. iii. 43 and whereas
it was lawful for them at that distance to approach the taber-
nacle on the sabbath day3 hence they argue for the two thou-
sand cubits as the sabbath day’s journey, which we are now
inquil-ing into. But, by the way, let us take notice of the
“ foul· cubits,” which they gathered from those words, “ Abide
ye every man in his place.'' Which must be thus understood:

gone beyond the limits of the sabbath, and afterward came
