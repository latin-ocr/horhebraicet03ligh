defective in some of their parts, &c.; by which they kept
parents in awe, lest they should grow remiss and negligent in
the performance of some rites which had respect to their being

clean, such as washings and purifyings‚ &c. We have given
instances elsewhere.

ΙΙ. Butg that the infant should be born lame or blind, or
defective in any part, for any sin or fault of his own, seems
a riddle indeed.

1. Nor do they solve the matter who fly to that principle
of the μετεμψύχωσις, or transmxiffl‘ation of souls, which they
would have the Jews tinctured with 3 at least if we will admit
Josephus as a just interpreter and judge of that principle.
For thus heh ε

It is the opinion of the PhariseeS, Ψυχὴν πᾶσαν μὲν ἄφ-
θαρτον μεταβαίνειν δὲ εἰς ἕτερον σῶμα τὴν τῶν ἀγαθῶν μόνην,
τὴν δὲ τῶν φαύλων ἀϊδίῳ τιμωρίᾳ κολάζεσθαι that “ the soulS
of all are immortal. and do pass into another body; that is,
those of the good only [observa this] ; but those of the wicked
are punished with etei-nal torments.” So that unless you will
say that the soul of some good man passing into the body of
this man was the cause of his being born blind (a supposition
that every one would cry shame of), you say nothing to the
case in hand. If the opinion of the transmigration of souls
amongst the Jews prevailed only so far, that they supposed
‘the souls of good men only’ passed into other bodies the
very subject of the present question is taken away3 and all
suspicion of any punishment or defect happening to the infant
upon the account of transmigration wholly vanisheth, unless
you will say it could happen upon a good soul’s passing out of
the body of a good man.

Q, There is a solution attempted by some from the soul's
preexistency3 which, they would pretend, the ‘Jews had some
smatch of, from what they say about- mnam summ those souls
which are in Gom, 01· Gaph.

Jevamoml, where it is ascribed to Rs. *DN Asi.
