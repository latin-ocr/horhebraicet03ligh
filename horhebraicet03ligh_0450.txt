As to those cherubims that were in Solomon’s Temple,
2 Chron. iii. 10, I cannot but by the way observe what Ι
111001 with in Bava Bathrap: ‘⁶ Onkelos the proselyte saith,
mmmm ΠΨἎΠ.) ῦἾΞἾἾῧ, ‘ The cherubim are like children
qoiny from their master.’ '’ That· is, with their faces turned
partly towards their master, and partly towards the way
wherein they were to go, For as 1110 Gemarists‚ “ When
Israel obeyed 1110 will of God, 1110 cherubims looked towards
one another; but when they did not, then they turned their
faces towards the walls.'' ,

Thus Onkelos comments upon this place of the Chro-
nicles. I hardly think he Targumizeth on the book3 for the
Targum‚ at least that which is in our hands, renders it, ΓΞἹὊ
TUQUE) 73:127 ΓὛἾΠ Both the cherubim are made of lily work.

Ver. 17 : Μή μου ἅπτου, οὔπω γὰρ ἀναβέβηκα, &Q Touck me
ηοω for I am not yet ascended «30] These words relate to
what he had spoken formerly about sending the Comforter‚
and that he would not leave them comfortless, &c And this
probably Mary Magdalene's mind was intent upon when she
fell at his feet and would have embraced them. But he, ‘⁴ I
must first ascend to my Father before I can bestow those
things upon you which I have promised: do not therefore
touch me and detain me upon any expectation of that kind;
but wait for my ascension rather3 and go and tell the same
things to my brethren for their encouragement.''

Ver. 23‘1 : ’Ἂν τινων ἀφῆτε τὰς ἁμαρτίας, ἀφίενται· Whose so-
ever sins με remit, they are remitted] He had formerly given
them a power of ‘ binding and loosing ς’ and therefore proba-
bly bestows something more upon them now than what hc
had conferred before. For,

I. It would seem a little incongruous for our Saviour to use
an action so new and unwonted, such as was his ⁶ breathing
upon them‚' to vest them only with that power which he had
before given them.

ΙΙ. Τ110 power of ‘ binding and loosing' was concerned only
in the articles and decisions of the law 3 this power which he
now gives them reached to the sins of mankind. That power
