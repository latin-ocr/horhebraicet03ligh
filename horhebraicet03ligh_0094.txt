thou shalt hear, and learn and add.” That is not much un-

Vna. 3 : Μήτε ἀνὰ δύο χιτῶνας ἔχειν· Neitlm· Ιιαυθ two coats
apiece.] Either my computation of times very much deceives
me, or the winter was now coming on when the apostles were
sent sorth3 and yet Christ forbids that they should be clothed
with a double garment. It was not much that they should

austerities of their life, both as to food and clothing. And
so it is said particularly of the priests.

languished, and their bowels grew infirm.”

For m this very reason was there a physician appointed in
the Temple, upon whom the charge lay of remedying this
evil : whom we might not unfitly call the howel-doctor.

Now, it may be inquii-ed whether our Lord from this
example prescribed this severity to his apostles, not allowing
