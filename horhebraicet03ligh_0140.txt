Ver. 24: Οὐδὲ ταμεῖον, οὐδὲ ἀποθήκη· EVez'thcr storehouse nor
barm] I am mistaken if the Jerusalem writers would not
render it ῙἾἿ) ΝἷῖἾ ηΠἾῖ) &³7 ς for ῆΠἻὩ was the storehouse
where they laid up their fruits, and ζἻἾλ was the barn where
they laid up their grain. It is commonly rendered the floor,
but there it is meant the barn-floor. Our Saviour takes an
instance from God feeding the ravens, Job xxxviii. 41, Psalm
cxlvii. 9, where it is R. Solomon's remark: “ 0111· Rabbins
observe, that the raven is cruel towards its young; but God
pitieth them, and provides them flies [muscas]‚ that breed
out of their own dung.'’ Now the reason they give why the
old ones are so unmerciful to their own young is in Olmtub-
both ²1, where the Gloss thus explains the minds of the Gema-
rists speaking of the young ones ’ὩἎἸΝἾ ’ἾἾἾΠ both white
(md blach: “When they grow black the old ones begin to
love their young, but while they are all white they loathe
them.” ’

nur transcribing: “ There was a certain man brought before
Rabh J udah because he refused to provide for his children.

that ‘ God feeds them :' but that is said of them when they are
become black, that ‘ the raven owneth her young.' ’³ But the
Gloss hath it thus: “It seems as if he with his own voice
should cry out against himself, aud say, ‘ The raven owneth
her young.' But there are those that expound it as if the
minister of the synagogue should set him forth and proclaim
upon him, 'Phe raven acknowledgeth her young, but t'his man .
