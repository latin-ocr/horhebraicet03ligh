day, to bey I am aslaamed] Is there not some third thing
betwixt diquz'ny and beygyiny ,9 The distinction betwixt ΓΞὩἾΝ
and Γὶᾋῆῑῦ artificem and lahoewers, mentioned in Bana Illezr'a ⁰,
hath place here. This steward, having conversed only with
husbandmen, must be supposed skilledp in no other handi-
craft3 but that if he should be forced to seek a livelihood, 110
must be necessitated to apply himself to dito-qim] in the vine-
yards, or fields, or olive-yards.

Ver. 6 : Δέξαι σου τὸ γράμμα, &a Take thy bill, ἃᾶ] That
is, “Take from me *summ clm soroll [schedulam] of thy concreta,
which thou deliveredst to me, and make a new one, of fifty
measures only, that are owing by thee.'' But it seems a great
inequality, that he should abate one fifty in a hundred mea-
sures of oil, and the other but twenty out of a hundred mea-
sures of wheat3 unless the measures of wheat exceeded the
measure of oil ten times: so that when there were twenty
cori of wheat abated the debt0r‚ there were abated to him
two hundred baths or ephahs.

Ver. 9: Ἐκ τοῦ μαμωνᾶ τῆς ἀδικίας· Of tlae mammon of
anriyhteousness] Ι. Were 1 very well assured that our Sa-
viour 111 this passage meant riches well gotten, and alnis to
be bestowed thence, I would not render it mammon of an-
riylzteoasness, but hamffnl mammon. For ἀδικεῖν signifies to
hamt, as well as to deal unjastly .· μὴῆ ἀδικήσατε τὴν γῆν.
Vulg.; nolite nocere temne,- hart not the earth. And so riches,
even well got, may be said to be μαμμωυᾶ ἀδικίας, Ῐιῑινζίὶιῖ
mammon ; because it frequently proves ozooeious to the owner.
It is the lawyers’ term, ῙἾῺὮ px: tlte damaqe of mammon
(Maimonides hath a treatise with that title ῙἸὩῺ VD), that
is, when any person doth any way hart or damnify another’s
estate. And in reality, and on the contrary, 373] UDX) lcarffal
mammon, i. e. when riches turn to the hart ancl mischief of the
owner. And if Ι thought our Saviour here speaks of riches
honestly gotten, I would suppose he might- use this very word
ΡΠ, only that the phrase of pu pm: is not so usual amongst
the Jews as “sinn ΡΠ.

II. Or perhaps he might call it mammon of anmylzteoasness,
in opposition to mammon ΠΡἿἻΞΞ of riylzteonsness, i. e. of marey,
