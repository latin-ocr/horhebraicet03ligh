with the place in Ezra before quoted, we may believe they
are not much amiss), then the ἐφημερίσι τοῦ Ἀβιῑι, the course
of Abiala both here and Nehem. xii. 17, must not so much
be understood of the stock or raee of Abijah‚ as that that
course retained the name of Abijah still. For though there
were four-and-twenty classes made up of the four only
named, yet did they retain both their ancient order and
ancient names too, If therefore Jehoiarib, i. e. his course,
should come up out of Babylon (which, however, did not
happen)‚ it was provided that he should not disturb the fixed
and stated order by intruding into the first place3 but re-
taining the name of J ehoiarib in the first class, which con-
sisted now of those of Jedaiah‚ ἐφημερία, his course, should
be distributed amongst those orders.

ΙΙ. The Rabbinsi have a tradition ε there were twenty-four
courses of priests in the land of Israel, and twelve courses in
Jerieho. What! twelve in J ericho? This would increase the
number too much. No3 but there were twelve of those in
J ericho3 that when the time came about that any course
should go up to Jerusalem, half a course went up from the
land of Israel, and half a course from J ericho, that by them

might come a supply both of water and food to their brethren
that were at J erusalem.''

Gloss 2—-“ When the time came that any course should go
upk to Jerusalem, it divided itself, that half of it should go

to JerichO, that they might supply their brethren with water
and food.” 8εο.

ΙΙΙ. As to the circulation of these courses or turns, we may
guess something of it from the Gloss in Miclras coheleth&
The Midras itself hath these words: “'It is R. Chaija' s tra-

dition: It is written, mum-7 misum runa& 37:312? Seven

weeks shall be complete, i. e. between the Passover and Pente-
cost, Levit. xxiii. 15. But when are they so? ΓΜ.) ῖῃῖἱ
