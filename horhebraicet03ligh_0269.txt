niersf’ But Γ so miserably was she and the whole family im-
poverished‚ that “ Rabbans Jochanan Bon Zacchai saw her
gathering barleycorns out of the dung of the Arabs' cattle:
saith he to her, ‘ W ho art thou, my daughter ’ζ’ ‘ Ι am (saith
she) the daughter of Nicodamus Ben (Emi-ion) ‘ What then
<saith he) is become of all thy fathers wealth 2’ ” &c.

I leave it with the reader to determine with himself who<
ther the Nicodamus mentioned aniongst them bo the same
with this of ours or no. It is not much for tho reputation
of that Nicodamus (whatever may be supposed in tho affirm·
ative), that these authors should all along make so honour-
able mention of him. However, some passages look as if it
might be the same man, viz„ the name Bomn', by which he
went for a disciple of Jesus; the impoverishment of his fa
mily, which may be coneeived to fall upon them in the perse-
eution of Christianity, &az but it is not tanti that we should
labour at all in a thing so very perplexed, and perhaps no less
unprofitable.

Ver. 2 ε Οἴδαμευ· We know] It may be a quest-ion whether
Nicodemus‚ using the plural number [wc know]‚ does by thal>
seem to own that the whole Sanhedrim (of which himself was
a member) acknowledge the same thing. Ι an] apt to think
the fathers of the Sanhedrim could not well tell how indeed
to deny it: which will be more largely discussed upon chap.
xi. 48. But οἴδαμεν may either be the plural or the singu-
lar, which in the first person is most commonly used in all
languages 5 and &ly-1³¹ and &l'ssffil [which, 1 question not,
Nicodemus promiseuously used] may be indifferently taken
for either number, singular or plural. Or else, we know, may
signify as much as, it εἰς commonly owned and aokizowledyed.

Ἀπὸ Θεοῦ ἐλήλυθας διδάσκαλος· Thou art a wacker come from
Gocl] Nicodemus seems to have reference to the long cessa-
tion of prophecy which had not been known in that nation
sor above four hundred years now past 3 in which space of
time there had been no masters or teachers of the people
instituted but by men and the imposition of hands; nor had
there in that appeared any one person that would pretend to
teach them by a spirit of prophecy :-But we see tlcat thou art
α- toacher sentfmm (θοαί.
