Oh. i. 4.] Emercitations upon St. Jolm. 289

τοῦ πορεύσεται λόιμός; sor the meaning of the prophet there is,
before his face went ‘ the pestilence?

Ver. 4: Ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἣν· In kim was lisia] The evangelist
proceeds from the creation by ὁ Λόγος, the Word, to the re—
demption of the world by the same Word. He had declared·
how this W‘ord had given to all creatures their first being,
ver. 33 “ All things were made by him :⁹³ and he now shew-
eth how he restored life to man when he lay dead in tres-
passes and sins. “ Adam called his wife-'s name Hecale,

[Πᾎζῖ] ἷῑγὲΓ [Eve. A. V. ΟῘιαυαῘι, margin] Gen. iii. 20: the
Greek 1·eadS‚ Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἀδὰμ τὸ ὄνομα τῆς γυναικὸς, Ζωή,
Adam called his wffe's name, ⁶ Lff0·' He called her Life who
had brought in deatlm because he had now tasted a better
life in the promise of the woman's seed. To which it is very
probable our evangelist had some reference in this place.

Καὶ ἡ ζωὴ ἣν τὸ φῶς τῶν ἀνθρώπων· And the lofe was the liylat
of mem] Life through Christ was liyht arising in the dark-
ness of man’s fall and sin ; a liykt by which all believers were
to walk. St. John seems in this clause to oppose the sze and
Ziykt exhibited in the gospel, to that ἀγὲ and ligykt which the
Jews boasted of in their law, They expected life from the
works of the law, and they knew no greater liqlat than that
of the law3 which therefore they extol with infinite boasts
and praises which they give it. Take one instance for all:
‘⁶ Godi said, Let there be liylzt. R. Simeon saith, Liqlzt is
written there five times, according to the five parts of the
law [i. e. the Pentateueh]‚ and God said, Let there be hym,-
according to the book of Genesis, wherein God, busying him-
self, made the world. And there was lissam according to the
book of Exodus, wherein the Israelites came out of darkness
into liyht. And God saw the liyht that it was good 3 ac-
cording to the Book of Levifficus, which is filled with rites
and ceremonies. And Orod divided betwixt the liqht and the
darkness; according to the Book of Numbers, which divided
betwixt those that went out of Egypt, and those that entered
into the land. And God called the aym, day; according to
the Book of Deuteronomy, which is replenished with mani-
fold traditions.'’ A gloss this is upon liykt, full of darkness

indeed !
