Oh. xi. ¹9·] Eoeeroitatz‘ons upon St. Jolm. 363

“ Whenn they return from the grave they stand in a circle
about the mourner comforting him.” Gloss: ‘⁶ The circle
about him consists of ten at least.'’ But usually it is very
crowded and numerous. Hence that passage⁰ :

1:³⁸5me numum ΠἾἾΚΗΞ ΓἻὈἾὩ “As to those that stood
about in that circle, those that were on the inside ofit were not
obliyed to repeat the phylacteries3 but those that were on the
outside were bound.”

‘⁶ Thep Rabbins deliver: The seven standings and sittings
for the dead must not be diminished.'’ Where the Gloss is3
“When they returned from the grave, they went forward a
little, and then sat down; partly to comfort the mourners,
partly to weep themselves, and partly to meditate upon the
subject of mortality. Then they stood up again, and went on
a little, and sat down again, and so for seven times. But I
have seen it written, that they did this upon the account of
the evil spirits who accompanied them from the grave. They
ordained these standings and sittings, that within that time
the evil spirits might depart.''

So that we see they were wont to comfort the mourners in
the way as they were returning from the grave, and they
would bring them back to their own house the day that the
party deceased was interred. They comforted them also all
the remaining days of mourning, which we find done in this
place.

Thirty days were allotted for the time of mourning: but,
