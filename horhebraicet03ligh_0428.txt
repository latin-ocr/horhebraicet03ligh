and then it was under certain conditions. “ Whenx is it that
they bring the Chayigyah at the same time with the lamb?

mmmm marim: barm s: mrim pm When it comes on
another day in the weelc, and not on the sabbath ,· when it is

clean, and when it is small.” Let the Gloss explain the last
elause3 and for the two former, we shall do that ourselves.

my'mZ: “ If the lamb be less than what will satisfy the
whole company, then they make ready their Olmyigtak, eating
that first, and then the lamb‚” 850. And the reason is given
by another Glosser; viz, that the appetites of those that eat
might be pretty well satisfied before they begin the lamb:
for if they should fall upon the lamb first, it being so very
small, and the company numerous and hungry, they would be
in danger of breaking the bones, whiles they gnaw it so
greedily.

For this and other reasons the Rabbins account the Olca-
yiyak of the fourteenth day to be many degrees less perfect
than that of the fifteenth 3 but it would be very tedicus to
quote their ventilations [discussiones] about it. Take only
these few instanees :

‘¹ R. Issaiy saith, ‘The Okaqiyalz on the fourteenth day is
not our duty.⁹ '⁹ And a little after: “ R.Eliezer saith, ‘ By the
peace offerings which they slay on the evening of the feast, a
man deth not his duty, either as to rejoieing, or as to
Chccyiffcclc.' ’'

And now let us return to the words of our evangelist.

111. It was the fifteenth day of the month when the fathers
of the eouncil refused to enter into the praetorium, lest they
should be defiled3 for they would eat the Passover, that is,
the Olmffiyah.

1. The evangelist expresseth it after the common way of
speaking, when he calls it the Passovor. “ It is writtenz,
