but that of the apostle, 1 Cor. xv. 5, ὤφθη Κηφᾷ, εἶτα τοῖς

can seem expressed more clearly in the confirmation of this
matter.

object Ρ. But it may be objected, that those two returning
from Emmaus found the eleven apostles gathered and sitting
together. Now if Simon was not amongst them. they were not
eleven. Therefore he was not one of those two.

Ans. Ι. If it should be granted that Peter was there and
sat among-st them, yet were they not exactly eleven then,
sor Thomas was absent, John xx. 24. ΙΙ. When the eleven
are mentioned, we must'not suppose it exactly meant of the
number of apostles then present, but the present number of
the apostles.

Ver. 37: Ἐὃόκουν πνεῦμα θεωρεῖν· They supposed they] had
seen a spirit] Whereas the Jews distinguished between
angels and spirits and demons; spirits are defined by R.
Hoshaiahq to be ⁴⁸ such to whom souls are created, but they
have not a body made for those souls.⁷’ But it is a question,
whether they included all spirits or souls under this notion,
when it is more than probable that apparitions of ghosts, or
deceased persons who once had a body, were reckoned by
them under the same title. Nor do I apprehend the dis-
ciples had any other imaginat-ion at this time, than that this
was not Christ indeed, in his own person, as newly raised
from the dead3 but a spectrum only in his shape, himself
being still dead. And when the Phariseesr speak concerning
Paul, Acts xxiii. 9, “ That if an angel or α spirit had spoken
to him,'' I would easily believe they might mean it of the
apparition of some prophet, or some other departed just
person, than of any soul that had never yet any body created
to it. I¹the rather incline thus to think, because it is so
evident, that it were needless to prove how deeply impressed
that nation was with an opinion of the apparitions of departed
ghosts.
