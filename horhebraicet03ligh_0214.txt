208 Hebrew and Talmudz'cal [Oh. xxii. 47·

their bites would occasion most bitter deaths: they are horrible
potins that afflict any that are struck by them, and om issue of
sweat, like blood, seizetk them.'' I would ascribe this bloody sweat
of our Saviour to the bite of that old serpent, rather than to
the apprehension of divine wrath.

Ver. 47 z Φιλῆσαι αὐτόν· ΤΟ kiss him] Our Saviour had to
do with a frightful and terrifying devi13 but this traitor seems
possessed with a tame and gentle one. He converses with
the apostles, and there is no token of a devil dwelling in him.
He is present at the Passover, at the eucharist, and the very
lips of Christ, and still no sign of Satan being his inmate. But
when once the devil hath done his work by thee, then, J udas,
take heed of thy devil.

As to this treacherous contrivance of J udas, let us frame
the most gentle opinion of it that the matter can bear: for
instance, that he might perhaps think with himself, that it
was not possible for Christ to be apprehended by the Jews,
having already seen him working such stupendous miracles,
and more than once strangely delivering himself from them:
and grant further, that when he said to them, ‘⁶ Whomsoever
I shall kiss, that is he, lay hold of him,'' he said it scoffingly,
as believing they could not be able to lay hold on him: grant
we, in a word, that when he saw him condemned, he repented
himself, having never suspected that matters would have gone
so far, presuming that- Christ would easily have made his
escape from them, and himself should have got thirty pieces
of silver by the bargain: let us grant, I say, that this was his
contrivance, and colour it over with as plausible excuses as we
can; yet certainly was there never any thing so impiously
done by mortal man, than for him thus to play with the Holy
of Holies, and endeavour to make merchandise of the Son of
God. However, Ι suspect much worse things hatched in the
breast of this traitor: viz. that Christ did really not please
him; and, with the great chiefs of that nation, though he sup-
posed him the true Messiah, yet not such a one as answered
their carnal expectation.
