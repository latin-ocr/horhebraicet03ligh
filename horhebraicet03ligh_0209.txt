Ch. xxii. 21.] Exercitations upon St. Luke. 203

IV. This cup which is slzed for yma] This seems to
have reference to that cup of wine that was every day poured
out in the drink offerings with the daily sacrifice; for that
also was poured out- for the remission of sins. So that tho
bread may have reference to the body of the daily sacrifice,
and the cup to the wine of the drink offering.

V. My blood of the new testantem] So St. Matthew [xxvi.
28,] and St. Μαι-Ι( [xiv. 24‚] with reference to ‘⁶ the blood of
bulls and of goats,'' with which the old testament was con-
firmed, Exod. xxiv; Heb. ix. 19.

Vl. The new testantem in mg] blood] So our evangelist
and so the apostle, 1 Cor. xi. [25] with reference to the.whole
ministry of the altar, where blood was poured out; nay, with
respect to the whole Jewish religion, for here was the begin-
ning or entry of the new covenant. And indeed it seems that
the design of that frequent communion of the Lord's supper
in the first ages of the chureh, among other thingS, was, that
those who were converted from J udaism might be scaled and
confirmed against Judaism; the sacrament itself being the
mark of the cessation of the old testament and the beginning
of the neW.

Ver. 21 ε Πλὴν ἰδοὺ ἡ χεὶρ τοῦ παραδιδόντος, διο. But, behold,
the lzcmd of lcim that betruyeth, me, αξη] What can be desired
more as a demonstration that J udas was present at the eucha-
rist? And whereas the contrary is endeavoured to be proved
out of John xiii, nothing is made out of nothing: for there is
not one syllable throughout the whole chapter of the paschal
supper, but of a supper before the ‘ feast of the Passover.'

Ver. 26: “Ως ὁ νεώτερος· As the younqew] The vulgar and
interlinear‚ sicut junior. We, as the younyer, very well. For,
as Beza hath it upon the place, νεώτερος, proprie dieitur de
aetate .- it is properly to bc understood of aye. I ask therefore,

Ι. Whether Peter was not the oldest of the whole com-
pany? What reason can any have to deny this? It was ne-
cessary that some one of them should be the first both in number
and order; and it was as fit and equal that the oldest amongst
them should be reckoned the first. And who will you say was
older than Peter? Hence was it that he hadh the first place
in the catalogue of the apostles, because he was the oldest.
