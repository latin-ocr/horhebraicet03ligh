And it is not necessary to say, He does not die upon the
account of a Gentile: for they are not esteelned by them for
their neiylcbouffl’

“ Τ1101 Gentiles, amongst whom and 118 there is no war, and
so those that are keepers of sheep amongst the Iffluelites, and
the like, we are not to contrive their death: but if they be in
any danger of death, we are not bound to deliver them:
e. g. If any of them fall into the sea, you shall not need to
take him out: for it is said, Thou shalt not rise up against
the blood of thy neighbour3 ἺΞῙἾ ΓΠ ΤΝἾ bat such a one is not

Ver. 30: ’Ἄνθρωπός τις κατέβαινεν ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἷς Ἱεριχώ·
Α certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jerz'elco] This was
the most beaten and frequented road in the whole land of
Israel, and that, not only as it led to Perea, but also upon
the account of that great traffic that was between these two
011108, especially because of the courses that were as well in
Jericho as Jerusalem. Of which we have discoursed else—
wherem. To which I shall superadd this passage out of
Jerusalem Taenia-0¹¹.- “ The former prophets instituted four-
and-twenty courses, and for every course Dssw'lssl ἾἾὮὩ ΠἿΠ
there was α stationary class of priests, Levites, and Israelites
in Jerusalem. It is a tradition: Four-and-twenty thousand
was the stationary number out of Jerusalem, ἾἾὨΞ) *sl-n
ἾΠἾἾἾὉ and Izaff that station out of Jerieko. J ericho could
indeed have produced an entire station; but that it would
give the preference to J erusalem3 and therefore it produced
but half.”

Here, therefore, you may see in this historical parable why
there is such particular mention made of a priest and Levite
travelling that way, because there was very frequent inter-
course of this sort of men between these towns, and that
upon the account of the stations above mentioned.
