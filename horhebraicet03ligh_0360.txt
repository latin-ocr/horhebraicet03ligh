should celebrate the restitution of their sacred ritas by a feast of
eiykt days' continuance. Καὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου μέχρι δεῦρο τὴν ἑορτὴν
ἄγομεν καλοῦντες αὐτὴν Φῶτω Andfrmn that time to this do we
still celebrate this feast, calling] it by tlze omme of ‘1229thst
giving that name to this feast, as I suppose, because we ob-
tained such a liberty so much beyond all hope.”

One would believe that the name only of liykts, or canones,
was given to this feast: I say a name only3 for we have no
mention here of the ‘lighting of candles.' One wouldz be-
lieve also that the eight days decreed for the celebration of
this feast was done after the pattern of the eight days' feast
of Tabernmffis: but you will find in the Talmudic authors
that it is far otherwise, and they have a cunning way of talk-
ing concerning it.

“ The Rabbinsa have a tradition : From the five-and-twen-
tieth day of the month Chisleu there are eight (lays of the
Encaenia [or feast of Dedication], in which time it is not law-
ful either to weep or fast. For when the Greeks entered into
the Temple, they defiled all the oil that was there. But
when the kingdom of the Asmoneans had conquered them,
they sought and could not find but one single vial of oil
that had been laid up under the seal of the chief priest3 nor
was there enough in it but to light for one day. There was
a great miracle: for they lighted up the lamps from that
oil for eight days together: so that, the year after, they
instituted the space of eight days for the solemnizing that
feast.'’

Maimonides relates the same things, and adds moreb:
“ Upon this occasion the wise men of that generation ap-
pointed, that eight days from the 2 5th of the month Ghisleu
should be set apart for days of rejoicing and the Hallel: and

that they should light up candles at the doors of every house ·

each evening of those dayS‚ to keep up the memor-y of that
miracle. Those days are called ΠΞὊΠ Dedication; and it is
forbidden upon all those days either to weep or fast, as in the
days of Purim‚’' &a
