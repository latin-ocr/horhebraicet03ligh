Olgject. But probably this disciple was not ignorant that
Christ had already delivered to them a petitionary form in
that Sermon of his upon the Mount: and therefore what
need had he to desire, and for what reason did he importune
another?

Answer. It is likely he did know it3 and as likely he did
not expect the repetition of the same again: but being very
intent upon what John had done for his disciples, did hope
for a form more full and copious, that might more largely
and particularly express what they were to ask for, according
to what he had observed probably in the form that had been
prescribed by John: but the divine wisdom of our Saviour
knew, however, that all was sufficiently comprehended in
what he had given them. And as the Jews had their 1³92
skort summamd of those eighteen prayers epitomized, so
would he have this form of his a short summary of all that
we ought to ask for.

Ver. 40 : Μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν· Ami lead us not
into templatim] I am much deceived if this petition is not
amongst other things, and indeed principally, and in the first
place, directed against the visible apparitions of the devil, τοῦ
πονηροῦ, the evil one: as also his actual obsessions: by which
the phrase of God’s ‘leading us into temptation' is very
much softened.

The doxology, ⁶ For thine is the kingd0m‚’ ἄτα, is left out,
because it was our Saviour's intention in this place to deliver
to them a form of prayer merely petitionary 3 for which very
same reason also, Amen is omitted too. Fors ἐρεῖ Ἀμὴν ἐπὶ
τῇ εὐχαριστίᾳ, lae shall say Amen at thy qiviny of thafnks: and
indeed they commonly ended all their prayers, even those
that consisted most of petition‚ with thanksgiving and bene-
diction; concluding in this manner, “Blessed be thou, Ο
Lord‚ who hast thus done, or thus commanded‚'' or the like;
and then was it answered by all, Amen. This we may observe
