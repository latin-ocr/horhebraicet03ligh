throughout his whole life the roof of his house had not seen
what was within that shirt of his.’'

II. And now the question returns; viz, whether by those
δύο χιτῶνας in the place before us should be meant those two
kinds of garments. the talida and the chalab, that is, that
they should take but one of them: or those two kinds
doubled3 that is, that they should take but one of each?
Whether our Saviour bound them to take but one os those
garments, or whether he forbade them taking two of each?

I conceive, he might bind them to take but one of those
garments ε for, although χιτώυ when joined with ἱμάτιον may
be applied to some particular garment, yet when it is not so
joined it may signify only clothing in general. When our
Lord commands thern μὴ ἐνδύσασθαι δύο χίτωυας, not to put
on two coast, the foregoing words may best explain what
he means by it: for when he cuts them short of other parts
of garments and neeessaries, such as a scrip, a staff,
and sandals, we may reasonably suppose he would cut them

short of one of the ordinary garmentS‚ either the talith or
the chaluk.

This may seem something severe, that he should send
them out in the winter time half naked; but, 1. This well

exert towards them in a more peculiar manner, as may be
gathered from Luke xxii. 3 5, and to the charge of which he
would commit them. Of such a kind and nature was his
providence in preserving them, as was shewn towards the
Israelites in the wilde-mess, which suffered not their gar-ments
to wax old, which kept their bodies from decay and diseases,
and their feet unhurt by all their travel. 2. It suited well
enough with the mean and low estate of that kingdom of
heaven, and of the Messiah‚ which the apostles were to preach
up and propagate3 so that, from the view of the first pub-
lishers, the Jews might learn to frame a right judgment con-
cerning both the Messiah and his. kingdom 3 viZ. they might
