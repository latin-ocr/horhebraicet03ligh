(Ah. xi. 44] Eme-'itatenus upon St. Jolm. 369

vised to pay tribute to Caesar, taught things contrary to what
the scribes and Pharisees had principled them in, shook and
seenled to abrogate the religion itself‚ and they had no prospect
at all of bettei thing os sioni hi1n; let Jesus pelish‚ though he
were the trlue Messiah, for any thing that they cai ed rathe1
than J udalsm and their religion should be abolished.

Obj. But it is said, that what they did was through iguo-
rance, Luke xxiii. 343 Acts 1ii. 173 xiii. 173 1 Cor. 11. 8.

Ans. True indeed, through ignorance of the person: for
they did not know and believe the Messiah to be God as weil
as man3 they apprehended him mere man. Though they
suspected that J esus might be the Messiah, yet did they not
suspect that this J esus was the true God.

Let it then be taken for granted, that the fathers of the
Sanhedrim, under some strong conviction that this was the
true Messiah, might express themselves in this manner, “ All
men will believe on him, and the Romans will come‚'' &c. and
so what Oaiaphas said, “ It is expedient that one man should
die,⁷’ &a But where does the consequence lie in all this?
“All men will believe on him;’' erqo, “the Romans will
come,’' &c.

I. It is not altogether wide of the mark, what is commonly
returned upon this question: The Romans will come against
our nation, taking us for rebels to the emperor, in that, with-
out his consent, our people have entertained this J esus for the
King Messiah.

ΙΙ. Nor is it impertinent to this purpose what was the
ancient observation of the Jews from that of the prophet
Isaiah, chap. x. 34, xi. 1: ‘⁶ Lebanon shall fall by a mighty
one—and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of
Jesse,” viZ. That the coming of the'Messiah‚ and the de-
struction of the Temple, should be upon the heels one of
another.

The storyh is of an Arabian telling a certain Jew, while
he was at plough, that the Temple was destroyed, and the
Messiah was born; which I have already told at large upon
Matt. ii. Ι. But the conclusion of it is, “ R. Bon saith3
‘What need we learn from an Arabian? is it not plainly

“ enough written, Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one? And
