priests, Levites, and IsraeliteS, at· Je1·usaleni; the priests of
the course went up to Jerusalem to their service, the Levites
to their singing; and of all the statione, there were some
appointed and settled at Jerusalem that were to assist at
the sacrifices of their brethren. The rest assembled in their
own eities, poured out prayers that the sacrifices of their
brethren might be accepted; fasting, and bringing forth
the book of the law on their fast-day,” &a So the Gloss
hath it.

The reason of this institution as to stationary-men is given

ἿἛᾺ ³73 ἾὩἸὩ For how could every man's (ψήφῳ be made,
{f lae lcimseff were not present? Now, whereas the daily
sacrifice, and some other offerings, were made for all Israel,
and it was not possible that all Israel should be present,
these stationaries were instituted, who, in the stead of all
Israel, should put their hands upon the daily sacrifice, and
should be present at the other offerings that were offered for
all Israel. And while these were performing this at J erusa-
lem, there were other stationaries in every course, who, by
prayers and fasting in their own oities, helped forward‚ as
much as they could, the services of their bret-hren that were
at Jerusalem.

“ Theq children of Israel lay on their hands, but the Gen-
tiles do not. The men of Israel lay on their hands, but the
women do not. R. J ose saith, Abba Eliezer said to me, We
had once a calf for a peace offering: and bringing it into the
Court of the VVomen, the women put their hands upon it: not
that this belonged to the women so to do, ΠΠ] *mm 24³7&

A remarkable thing.

The priests, throughout all the courses, grew into a prodi-
gious number, if that be true in Jerusalem Tomitas3 “ R. Zeora
in the name of Rabh Houna said, That the least of all the
courses brought forth eighty-five thousand branehes of priests.”
A thing not to be eredited.
