in-law of Judah, Gen. xxxviii] “was ἃἾΠΝἾ ΝΠἚἻΞ, tlze
canella or {597ae of the place where he lived.” The Gloss is,
‘⁸ One of the most famous men in the city enlightening their
eyes.” Hence the title given to the Rabbins, ΝΠἾἾἾΠἾ mim:
the canello Qf the law .· &NJ-137 ΝΞἾΕἾΞ the lamp of light.

Ver. 39: Ἐρευνᾶτε τὰς γραφάς· Semela the Scripturas]
This seems not to be of the imperative, but indicative mood:
ῙἾΠἾἾ pn& ‘⁶ Ye search the Scripturas, for in them ye think
ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of me.
And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.” What
ΠΨἾἾ means is not unknown to any that have but dipped
into [triverunt] J ewish authors. It denotes a something more
narrow search into the Scripturese, something between mim
and Πῖἳζψ, an inquiry into the literal and cabalistical sense
of the words, as R. Bechai in every leaf shews by several
instances. Those treatises which are called Rabbotla are made

up of that kind of expositions, viZ. mystical 01· allegorical.

VER. 4: *Hv δὲ ἐγγὺς τὸ πάσχα· And the Passover was η’ἰρᾶ]
“Itf is a tradition. They inquire and discourse about the
rites of the Passover, thirty days before the feast.'’ &5⁸3ss
&2³73 0Ἶῦ “ Tkeg sense of 0Ἶῦ is haff: that is, half of those
thirty days before the feast, wherein they discourse of the
rites of it.''

From the entrance of these thirty days and so onward, this
feast was in the eyes and mouth of this people, but especially
in the ΒἾΞ, 01· fifteen days immediately before the Passover.
Hence, perhaps, we may take the meaning of these words,
ἣν δὲ ἐγγὺς τὸ πάσχα, the Passover was niylb.

From the entrance 01· beginning of these thirty days, viz.
“ From the fifteenth day of the month Adar, they repaired

the wayS, the streets, the bridges, the pools, ³73 ΓΨἸῺἸ
ΟἿΞἾΠ ’3-1Ἰῖ and despatched all other publio busim-ses,- they
painted the sepulchreS, and proceeded about D³N³7217h matters

qf a keteroyeneous nature.’'
