1. Tha-t the Jews' daily and common prayers, ordinary and
occasionaL consisted chiefly of benedictions and doxologies‚
which the title of that Talmudic tract, which treats of their
prayers, sufficiently testifies, being called ΠὉἾΞ [Beracotlz]
benedictions, as also that ΠῙὯἮΠ, tephillath, the general no-
menclature for prayer, signifies no other than rmw prccisiny,
i. e. benediction or doxologyy. To illustrate this matter, we
have a passage or two not unworthy our transcribing :

'vlam’ anm rm ms ‘mxv‘ ἔην “ Ρενῐι.ιφεκ a mom
boys for necessarios for himseff, and aflerward prayetlc. This is

that which is spoken by Solomon, when he saith, ΠτΞἿζῐ-ιῖζζὶᾶ
Γιῖἳξη-Ἶῃ-ἷῇζῇ To the prayer, and to the supplicationl’ Ἰ
omit 'the versions, because the Gemarists interpret it them-
selves ; τήνω -ιτ rhen rib-*nn ητ rm rinna is thyhillala,
and teplzillalc is bakkaslcala. Their meaning is this: The first
word of Solomon’s ΠΞἾ νὶηηαΙι, signifies prayer (ξω ΠΒἚΠ
rum as the Gloss hath it, i. e. prayer with precise, or domolo-(yffi)
the latter word, 07³7*le tephz'llale, signifies petition, or suppli-
catz'on ‚· Gloss, beygyz'ny for things necessary.

It cannot be denied but that they had their petitionary or
supplicatory prayers ; but. then, the benedictory or doxolo-
gical prayers were inore in number, and more large and
copious: especially those which were poured out occasionally
or upon present emergency. Read the last chapter of the
treatise Ι newly quoted, and judge as to this particular: read
the whole treatise, and then judge of the whole matter.

2. It may be reasonably supposed that the Baptist taught
his disciples a form of prayer different from what the J ewish
forms were. It stands with' reason, that he that was to bring
inb a new doctrine, (I mean new in respect to that of the
J ewish‚) should bring in a new way of prayer too; that is, a
form of prayer that consisted more in petition and suppli-
cation than the Jewish forms had done; nay, and another
sort of petitions than what those forms which were petitionary
had hitherto contained. For the disciples of John had been
instructed in the points of regeneration, justifying saith, par-
ticular adoption, sanctification by the spirit, and other doc-
trines of the gospel, which were altogether unknown in the
