attainments of philosophy. So that Julius Casar and M.
Antony being consuls, the world began to be measured.

“ That is, from the consulship of Caesar above mentioned
to the consulship of Augustus the third time, and Crassus,
the space of one-and-twenty years, five months, and eight
days, all the East was surveyed by Zenodoxus.

“ Fromm the consulship likewise of Julius Gaesar and M.
Antony to the consulship of Saturninus and Cinna, the space
of two-and-thirty years, one mouth, and ten days, the south
was measured out by Polyclitus 3 so that in two-and-thirty
years' time, the whole world was surveyed, and a report of it
given in unto the senates*

Thus he: though something obscurely in the accounts of
consuls, as also in his silence about the West; which things
I must not stand to inquire into at this time. This only
we may observo, that Julius Caesar was consul with Antony,
A.U.O. 7103 and that the survey of the Roman empire,
being two-and-thirty years in finishing, ended A. U. O. 742 ;
that is, twelve years before the nat-ivity of our Saviour.

Let us in the meantime guoss what course was taken in
this survey: Ι. It is very probable they drew out some geo-
graphical tableS, wherein all the countries were delineated,
and laid down before them in one view. ΙΙ. That these
tables or maps were illustrated by commentaries, in which
were set down the description of the countries, the names of
places, the account of distances, and whatever might be
necessary to a complete knowledge of the whole bounds of
that empire. That some such thing was dono by Augustus’s
own hand, so far as ooncerned Italy, seems hinted by a pas-
sage in Plinyn; “ Qua in re praefari necessarium est, Au—
thorem nos Divum Augustum secuturoso, descriptionemque,
ab eo factam, Italiae totius in regiones XI.” In which things,
