From the irksomeness and perplexity of this niceness doth
our Saviour acquit and absolve his followers 3 partly that he
might introduce the gospel liberty3 partly also consulting the
necessity of his disciples, who if they had been bound up to
that strictness in meats, what could they do when their con-
verse was to lie chiefly amongst persons perfectly unknown to
them?

Ver. 18: Ἐθεώρουν τὸν Σατανᾶν, διο. Ι behold Satan, 23⁴0]
‘⁶ Lucifer falling from heaven,'' Isa. xiv. 12, is the king of
Babylon divested of his throne and dominion. So is Satan
in this place. The word ἐθεώρουν, Ι behold, I would refer to
this very time: ‘⁶ When Ι sent you forth I saw Satan's fall at
hand, that he should be immediately despoiled of his power
and tyranny.” For when the Messiah had determined to ex-
hibit himself, and, in order thereunto, to send out so numerous
a multitude of persons that should publish his appearance, it
was absolutely necessary, and it could not otherwise be, but
that the power of Satan should sink, and his government be
shaken.

It is probable these seventy disciples were sent out upon
the approach of the feast of Tabernacles, and when there now
remained about half a year to the death of Christ. In which
intervalu of time Christ shewed himself'more openly, both by
the preaching of these persons, and also in his own personal
exhibition of himself, than before he had done. All which
things determining in his death, whose death was also the
death of Satan, might give him a very just occasion of saying,
I beleeld Satan as Ziyhtnianallfrom heaven, thrown out of his
throne and kingdom. Compare Rev. xii. 8, where ‘ heaven' is
to be interpreted ‘ the church.'
