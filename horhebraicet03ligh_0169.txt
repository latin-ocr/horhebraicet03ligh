stood an estate honestly got, and the discourse were about
giving os ahnS, yet would Ι hardly suppose the poor to be
those fi‘z‘encls here mentioned, but God and Christb. For
who else were capable 'of receiving) them into everlaste'ny laabim-
tions 5? As for the poor (upon whom these alins are bestowed)
doing this, as some have iinagined, is mere dream, and de-
serves to be laughed at rather than discussed.

In Bava Kamac we have a discourse about restitution of
goods ill gotten3 and amongst other things there is this pas-
sage: “ The Rabbins deliver3 ΠἮἾἾΞ *ihm pelvim those
that live upon violence (or thieves), and nsm’ers, if they make
restitution, their restitution is not received.” And a little
after, u'TUJD '‘DffllDD {³0:³22er rma-ww ΤὩἾἾ for shepherds.
eoeactors, <md publicans, restitution «is diffie-ult. (The Gloss is,
Because they have wronged so many, that they know not to
whom to restore their own.) ῙἿἾἾΞῺζἹ ΓἾἿὩΠἾ bat they (lo
make restitution to those who know their own qood& that were
purloined from 1110111. They say true, They do make restitu-
tion: but others do not receive it of them. To what end

then do they make restitution? ΞὛὩΨ ἾἾἼ ΠΝΒῙῚ, that they
may perform their duty towards God.

Upon what nicety it was that they would not allow those
10 1081111111011, from whom the goods had been purloined, I
will not stand to inquire. It was necessary, however, that
restitution should be made; that that which was due and
owing to God might be performed3 that is, they might not
retain in their hands any ill-gotten goods, but devote them to
some good use; and, accordingly, those things that were
restored, (if the owners could not know them agaim) were
dedicated to public use, viz. 5³:³2 *255237 to the use ofd the
synaqoyue: and so they made God their friend, of the μαμ-
μωνᾶ ἀδικίας, qood-s* that they had yaiozed by dishonesty and un-
riyhteousness.
