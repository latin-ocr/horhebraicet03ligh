os “ eating his flesh'' and “ drinking his blood.'' He tells
us, therefore, that these things must be taken in a spiritual

will then find how impossible a thing it is to eat my flesh and
drink my blood bodily: for how can you eat the flesh of one ι
that is in heaven? Yon may know, therefore, that I mean

V. But what sense did they take it in that did understand
it? Not in a sacrament-al sense surely, unless they were then
instructed in the death and passion of our Saviour3 for the
sacrament hath a relation to his death: but it sufficiently
appears elsewhere that they knew or expected nothing of

earthly and sensual. But to partake of the Messiah truly is
to partake of himself, his pure nature, his righteousness, his
spirit3 and to live and grow and receive nourishment from
that participation of him. Things which the J ewish schools
heard little of, did not believe, did not think3 but things
which our blessed Saviour expresseth lively and comprehen-

sively enough, by that of eating his flesh and drinking his
blood.
