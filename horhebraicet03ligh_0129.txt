viour either would teach, that rapine, injustice, and unright-
eousness might be cleansed vby giving of alms; or that he
would give them any counsel of this nature, when he knew
they were sufficiently tinctured with this kind of doctrine
already.

Ver. 45: Ἀποκριθεὶς δέ τις τῶν νομικῶν· Thon answered one
oftlw lawyers] Here seems a little difficulty, that whereas, in
the foregoing verse it is said, ‘⁶ Woe unto you scribes and
pharisees,” it is not Subjoined ἀποκριθεὶς δέ τις τῶν γραμματέων,
then mzswere-cl one of tlze scribes, but τις τῶν νομικῶν, one of the
lawyers; which scruple perhaps the Vulgar observing, made
him leave scribes ancl Plearisees wholly out. Our Saviour in-
veighs more peculiarly, and by name, against the PhariseeS‚
ver. 37,4¹2,43; and at length joins the scribes with them,
ver. 44. Hence that lawyer cavils and complains, either that
he had named the scribes in terms, or that he had accused
the Pharisees of nothing but what the scribes might be
equally accused of. As to this very scribe, did not he wash
his hands before dinner as the Pharisees did ἓ for it is said of
all the Jews, ἐὰνΠ μὴ πυγμῇ νίψωνται, except they waslc their
hands oft, eat now Did not the scribe tithe mint and rue as
well as the Pharisee? when We find that ΓΞΞἾῺ ΡἾἻ Ἶωζῖἲῇ
the titkiny of lterbs was instituted by the Rabbins. In0 a word,
the scribes and the Pharisees go hand in hand in that dis-
course of our Saviour's, Matt. xxiii; where he blameth both
the one and the other for the same things. So that it is plain
enough why this man complains3 but it is not so plain why
he should be termed “ one of the Zawgyers,” and not “ one of
the scribes.’'

Ι. It is not very easy distinguishing betwixt the scribe and
the Pharisee, unless that Pharisaism was a kind of tumour
and excrescenee as to superstition and austerities of religion
beyond the common and stated practice of that nation, even
of the scribes themselves. Whether that distinction betwixt
*1³17* siwalar, and ''vmbn α disciple, hints any difference as
to the austerity of religion, I cannot affirm; I will only lay a
passage or two in the reader's eye for him to consider.
