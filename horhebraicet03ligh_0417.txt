bear yet, were the institution of the Christian sabbath, and
the abolishing of the Jewish (the reason and foundation of
which, viz. his resurrection, they yet understood not); the
rejection of the Jewish nation‚ when they expected ‘ that the
kingdom should be restored to lsrael,’ Acts i. 6 3 the entire
change of the whole Mosaic dispensation‚ and the bringing in
of all nations in common within the pale of the chureh:
these and such like things as these belonging to the kingdom
of God, Acts i. 3, they could not yet bear. For though he
had plainly enough discoursed to them the destruction of
Jerusalem, Matt. xxiv, yet it is a question, whether they ap-
prehended either that their whole nation must be utterly
cast off, or that the rites¹¹ of Moses should be antiquated,
although he had hinted something of this nature to them
more than once.

Ver. 13 ε “Ocra ἂν ἀκούσῃ λαλήσει· Whatsoever he shall hear,

but if our Saviour expressed the sense of that word by ³7:¹7³,
he did in that also follow the familiar manner of speaking
known amongst the vulgar. And it should seem he inclined
rather to this sense, because he does not say, λήψεται καὶ δώσει,
he shall receive of mine and qtae,- but λήψεται καὶ ἀναγγελεῖ, he
shall receive and shew it unto you: by which the J ew would
understand ἾἾἿῺΒΠ p: ΒΞΡἾ he shall receive ofni-y doctrine,
or from my instructions. For the Holy Spirit is sent as an
instructor from the Son, as the Son is sent as a Redeemer
from the Father.
