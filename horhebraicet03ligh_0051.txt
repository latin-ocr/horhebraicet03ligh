ἡμέρας, that J oseph and Mary continued at Jerusalem all the
seven days3 which was indeed generally done by others for
devotion’s sake. And then think what numerous compa-
nies of people must be going away to this or that country,
yea, particularly, how great a crowd might be journeying,
together with Joseph and Mary, towards Galilee. So that
it may be less strange, if J esus had not been within his
parents' sight, though he had been among the crowd; nor
that though they did not see him, yet that they should not
suspect his absence.

The place where Christ was first missed by his parents is
commonly shewed at this day to travellers, much nearer
Jerusalem, by the name of Rem, but ten miles from that city.
You may believe those that shew it, as you think fit.

observed. “Then high priest came to read” [those places
which were to be read on the day of atonement]. ‘⁶ The cha-
zan of the synagogue takes the book, and gives it to the
ruler of the synagogue3 the ruler to the sagan ; the sagan to
the high priest,’' 8δο. Where the Gloss: ‘⁶ There was a syna-
