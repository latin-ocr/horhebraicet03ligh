Oh. xx. 23.] Ecceroitations upon St. Jolm. 445

Now that we may understand the words that are before us,
let us a little consider what is saidq Luke xxiv. 46 : “ Thus it
is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to riser
from the dead the third day: and that repentance and re-
mission of sins should be preached in his name among all
nations, beginning at J erusalem.” Which words we may
suppose he spoke before he uttered what is in this verse.
And so might there not, upon the occasion of those words,
arise some such scruple as this in the apostles' breasts: “ Is
it so indeed ’ἰ must remission of sins be preached to those in
Jerusalem who have stained themselves with the blood of the
Messiah himself? ⁶ Yes‚' saith he, ‘ for whose soever sins ye
remit, they are remitted unto them! '⁹ To this those words
of his upon the cross have some reference, Luke xxiii. 34;
‘⁴ Father, forgive them,'' διο. And, indeed, upon what foun-
dation, with what confidence could the apostles have preached
remission of sins to such wretched men, who had so wickedly,
so cruelly‚ murdered their own Lord, the Lord of life, unless
authorized to it by a peculiar commission granted to them
from their Lord himself?

'‘Av τινων κρατῆτε, κεκράτηνται· ΠῙΙιοεε soever με retain, they
are retained] Besides the negative included in these words,
that is, “If you do not- remit them, they shall not be re-
mitted‚” there is something superadded that is positive.
That is,

Ι. There is granted to them a power of smiting the rebel-
lious with present death, or some bodily stroke.

II. A power of delivering them over to Satan. Whence
had St. Peter that power of striking Ananias and Sapphira
with so fatal a bole, whence St. Paul that of striking Elymas
blind, whence of delivering over Hymeneus and Alexander
to Satan, if not from this very commission given them by
Christ? Christ himself never exercised this power himself,
There was not one person whom he struck either with death
or any afflictive disease: some indeed he raised, when they
had been dead, and infinite numbers of the sick and diseased,
whom he cured: he snatched several from the power of the
devils; he delivered none to them. That the apostles there-
fore might be capable of performing things osso high a nature,
