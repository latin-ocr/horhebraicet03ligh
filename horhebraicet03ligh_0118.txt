schools or synagogues of the Jews. And who would imagine,
therefore, that John Baptist should not teach his disciples to
pray for these things?

II. It is probable‚ therefore, that when this disciple re-
quested our Saviour that 'hhe would teach his disciples καθὼς
Ἰωάννης as John had done, he had respect to such kind of
prayers as these3 because we find Christ so far condescending
to him, that he delivers him a form of prayer merely peti-
tionary‚ as may appear both from the whole structure of the
prayer, as also in that 1116 last close of all the doxology,
‘⁶ For thine is the kingdom‚'' &a is here left wholly out;
being asked for a form that was δεητικὴ, 116 took care to
deliver one to them that was merely supplicatory. This is
confirmed by what follows concerning the man requesting
some loaves of his neighbour, adding withal this exhortation,
“Ask‚ and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find.'’
Which two things seem to answer those two things by which
supplicatory prayer is defined ; these are ‚5³7th sheelah,
askiozy, and Πζζηῖζῑ bakkashah„ seeluiny .· for if there may be any
difference in the meaning of these two words, I would suppose
it thus, balckaslzalb, or seekiny, may respect the things of Grod 3
so, “ Seek ye first the kingdom of God‚'’ &oz and sheelak, or
askiny, may respect those things which are necessary for our-
selves: which texture we find very equally divided in this
present form of prayer, where the three first petitions are in
behalf of God’s honour, and the three last in behalf of our
own necessaries.

It was in use amongst the Jews, when they fasted, to use a
peculiar sort of prayer, joined with what were daily, terming
it smyn ΠῖὈἛΠ the prayer of the fast. This we have
mentioned in Taanitk C, where it is disputed whether ΓΞῺῙἾὩ
ΠἾῺΨῖ) those tlcatfastedfor certain hozcrs only, and not for the
whole day, ought to repeat that prayer of the fast: as also,
in what order and place that prayer is to be inserted amongst
the daily ones. Now if it should be granted that John had
taught his disciples any such form, that might be particularly
adapted to their fastings, it is not very likely this disciple
had any particular reference to that, because the disciples of
Christ did not fast as 1116 disciples of John did. It. rather
