VER. 2 : “Os ἦν αὐτῷ ἔντιμος· 11710 was clear mato him] So
was Tabi to his master Rabban Gamaliel: of whom we meet
with several things up and down, particularly that iu Beracotk,
fol. 16. 2: ‘⁶ When his servant Tabi was dead, he received
consolations for him. His disciples say unto him, ί11168161,
thou hast taught us that they do not use to receive consola-
tions for their servants? He answered them saying‚ ‘ My
servant Tabi was not as other servants, he was most up-
right? ”

Ver. 5 ε Τὴν συναγωγὴν αὐτὸς ᾠκοδόμησεν ἡμῖν· He laath built
us a synayoyue] Ι. It was no unusual thing for one single
man to build a synagogue at his own charge: “ If ¹¹ any man
build a house, and afterward consecrated it to a synagogue, it
is of the nature of a synagogue.” Gloss: “Any0 one that
builds a synagogue and gives it to his fellow citizenS,” διο.

Α11(1 the doctors in that treatisev dispute much upon this
question, Whether it be lawful to sell a synagogue or to alie-
nate it to any civil use: and amongst the rest, they suppose
some one building a synagogue= but would at last reserve it to
his own proper use.

ΙΙ. Theyq had no scruple as to a Gentile's building it, since
the 1101111688 of the place consisted not so much in the building
as in its being set apart and dedicated to holy use; of which
we have some instance in Herod’s building the Temple. Such
a one had this centurion approved himself towards the J ewish
nation, that concerning his liberality and devotion in being at
the charges of building‚ they found no reason to move any
scruple.

Ver. 1 2 : Ἐξεκομίζετο τεθνηκώς· There was a dead man carried
out] Amongst the Talmudists, &2³³ ΠΕ) α dead corpse φθίῃς]
out, is commonly a phrase which is first understood of carrying
the corpse out of the court-gate.

“ Atr what time do they take their beds lower [inclinant] ἐ
From the time that the person deceased is carried out of the
court-gate of 1118 own house.''
