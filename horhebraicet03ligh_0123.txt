Ch. xi. 31 .] Exerez'tatz'ous upon St. Luke. 117

yreat army (for so is that clause rendered by some L¹), might
seem to sound something of this nature in his ears. But if
there was any kind of ambiguity in the word ΠΞῘἯΞ, as in-
deed there is none, 01· if interpreters doubted at all about it,
as indeed none had done, the great oracle of truth hath here
taught us that the queen did come to Solomon: but why
doth he term her the queen of ‘ the south? and not the queen
ef ‘ Sueba θ’

ΙΙ. There are plausible things upon this occasion spoken
concerning Sheba of the Arabianus, which we have no leisure to
discuss at present. I am apt rather to apprehend that 0111·
Saviour may call her the queen of the south in much a like
sense as the king of Egypt is called in Daniel ‘the king of
the south! The countries in that quarter of the world were
very well known amongst the Jews by that title: but I
question whether the Arabiam Saba were so or no. Grant
that some of the Arabian countries be in later ages called
Alz'emiu, or southern parts, yet I doubt whether so called by
antiquity, or in the days of our Saviour.

Whereas it is said that tlte queeu of the south came to hear
the wisdom os Solomon‚ is it worth the patience of the reader
to hear a little the folly of the Jews about this matter? Be-
cause it is said that she came to make a proof of his wisdom
by dark sayings and hard questionS‚ these doctors will be
telling us what kind of riddles and hard questions she put to
him. “ SheV saith unto him, ‘ If I ask thee any thing, wilt
thou answer me ἓ) He said, ‘It is the Lord that giveth
wisdom.’ She saith, ‘ What is this then? 'tm ΓΝΞῬ ’τ

cup, and one sucks it? Again saith she, ‘ I will ask thee one
thing more : What is this? A woman saith unto her son, Thy
