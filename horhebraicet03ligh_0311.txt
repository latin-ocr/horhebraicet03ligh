Alas, poor wretches! how [qualiter et qnantum] do you
deceive yourselvesl for it is to you that this passage of being
hungry while others eat does directly point.

Infinite are the dreams of this kind, particularly about
Leviathan and Behemoth, that are to be served up in these
feastsu.

ΙῙ. Compare with this especially what the Jews pro-
pound to themselves about their being fed with manna:
‘⁴ TheX latter Redeemer” [that is, M essiah ; for he had spoken
of the former redeemer, Moses, immediately before] “shall
be revealed against them, &a And whither will he lead
them? Some say into the wilderness of Judah ; others, into
the wilderness of Sihon and Og.'² [Note that our Saviour
the day before, when he fed such a multitude so miraculously,
was in the desert of Og, viz. in Batanea, or Bashan] ἾἾἾἹὩἸ
3⁷:⁴7 ΒΠῖῬ And shall make manna descend for them. Note
that. So Midras Coheletlzy: “ The former redeemer caused
manna to descend for them3 in like manner shall our latter
Redeemer 372*ss n& ἾἾἾἿἾ cause manna το come doum, as it is
written, ‘There shall be a handful of corn in the earth,'
Psalm lxxii. 163³

Ver. 32: Οὐ Μωσῆς δέδωκεν ὑμῖν τὸυ ἄρτον· Moses yave you
not that broad from heaven] The Gemarists affirm that. manna
was given for the merits of Moses. “ ThereZ were three good
shepherds of Israel, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam: and there
were three good things given us by their hands, a well, a
cloud, and manna: the well, for the merits of Mil-iam3 the
pillau of the cloud, for the mei-its of Aaron ; manna, 1⁸57sz
ΠΨἾΌ for the mem‘ts qs flloeesf'

Contrary‚ therefore, to this opinion of theirs‚ it may well
be said, Οὐ Μωσῆς δέδωκεν ὑμῖν τὸν ἄρτον, Moses did ‘not 92⁶oe
you this bread .· i. e. it was by no means for any merits of his.
But what further he might intend by these words you may
learn from the several expositors.

Ver. 39: Ἀναστήσω αὐτὸ ἐν τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ· Slzould mise
it up aquia ατ the last day] So also ver. 40 and 44, the em-
phasis lies in ἐσχάτῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, the last day.
