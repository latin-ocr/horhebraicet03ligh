enough to eat the Paschal lamb, if it had been to have been

eaten on that evening: but they had eaten it the evening
fore.

beII. Τὸ πάσχα, the Passover, therefore here doth not signify

the Pascha] lamb, but the Paschal Okaqiqak .· of which we will

remark these two or three things :

1. Deut. xvi. 2, Πῑ-Ὼξ) ξὶΠ-ΞΞἹ, “ Thou skalt sacrifice the

Passover unto the Lord' thy God, of the fiock and the herd.”
Where R. Solomon3 “ The flocks are meant of the lambs

and the kids; the herd of the Okayiqak.” And R. Bechai
in locum.- “ The flocks ΠΟΞ :wrm are for the due qf the

Passover5 the herd, rmum ’73θωῖ7 for the sacrffioes ff tlte
Chayiyak.” So also R Nachmanid: “ The herd‚ ᾸἹΠῙὩ
ΠᾸὮΠ for the celebration of the ‘ Olcayiqak.' '³ Pesaclzint:
1702 Πῖ ῙΝΒ lee flock fhr the Passover, ΠἎἿἎΠ n Ἶρὲ the
ooeen fin· the Okayiqalz.

Whereu the Gloss. p. 1 ε “ Doth not the Passover consist
wholly of lambs and kids? Exod. xii. 5. If so, why is it said
ἾΡΞ owen? To equal every thing that is used in the Passover.

ΠΞἹΠ &ww ἻΞἺ UOD Πῃ As tlze Passover [i.e. the Paschal
lamb] is of due, and is not taken but VSWWT {n out qf the
common flocks‚” neither from the first-born nor from the
tenths]; “so this also [i.e. of the oxen] is of due, and not
taken but out of the common herd.” See 2 Chron. xxx, 24,
&c.‚ and xxxv. 8, 9.

2. The Ohayiyah was for joy and mirth‚ according to that
in Deut. xvi. 14, “And thou shalt rejoice in the feast‚” Sto.
Hence the sacrifices that were prepared for that use are called
ΠΠῃῐυ Ἷῃῖῡῑυ sacrifices ofpeaoe or eucharistie cffirz'nys, sacri-
fices ij⁰s²l and mirth.

3. The proper time of bringing the Ohayiqah was the
fifteenth day of the month. Aruolz in :ll-1: ‘⁴ They ate, and
drank‚ and rejoiced, and were bound to bring their sacrifice
of Chayiyak on the fifteenth day;’' i. e. the first day of the
feast, διο.

There might be a time, indeed, when they brought their
Okayiyalc on the fourteenth day3 but this was not so usuah
