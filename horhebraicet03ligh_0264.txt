258 Hebrew aad Talmudz'cal [Ch. ii. 21 .

βασιλείας, αὐτόν τε τὸν ναὸν ἐπεσκεύασε, in elce fifteentlz year qs
his νείφῃ lae repairecl the Temple ,· because the fifteenth year of
his reign alone, after he had conquered Antigonus, was the
eighteenth year from the time wherein he had been deelared
king by the Romans. Now Herod (as the same Josephust
relates) lived thirty-seven years from the time that the Ro-
mans had deelared him kingg and in his thirty-fifth year
Christ was born 3 and he was now thirty years old when he
had this diseourse with the Jews. So that between the
eighteenth of Herod and the thirtieth of Christ exclusively
there were just forty-six years complete.

III. The words of our evangelist therefore may be thus
rendered in English : “ Forty-and-six years hath this Temple
been in building :⁵³ and this version seems warranted by Jo-
sephusu‚ who, beginning the history of G. Florus, the proou-
rator of J udea, about tho 1 Ith of Nero, bath this passage&
Ἐξ ἐκείνου μάλιστα τοῦ καιροῦ σύνεβη τὴν πόλιν ἡμῶν νοσεῖν,
προκοπτόντων πάντων ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖρον· F rom that time particularly
our city begam to lan-quisse, all tlcitzys syr-owing worse ancl worse.
He tells us further, that Albinus, when he went off from his
government, set open all the gaols and dismissed the prisoners,
and so filled the whole province with thieves and robberies.
He tells wit-hal, that king Agrippa permitted the Levite sing-
ing-men to go about as they pleased in their linen garments z
and at length concludes, ’Ἡὸη δὲ τότε καὶ τὸ Ἱερὸν τετέλεστο·
“ And now was the Temple finished [note that]; wherefore
the people, seeing the workmen, to the number of eighteen
thousand, were at a stand, having nothing to do besought
the king that he would repair the poreh upon the east,’' διο.
If therefore the Temple was not finished till that time, then
much less was it so when Christ was in it. Whenee we may
properly enough render those words of the Jews into such a
kind of sense as this: ‘⁶ It is forty-and-six years since the re-
pairing of the Temple was first undertook, and indeed to this
day is not quite perfeeted3 and wilt thou pretend to build a
new one in three days3'’
