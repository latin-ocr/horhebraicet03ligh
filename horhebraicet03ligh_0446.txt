indeed, that Moses makes no mention of water, Exod. xxiv:
but the apostle, writing to the Hebrews, does not write with-
out such authority as they could not tell how to gainsay.
And if my memory do not fail me, I think I have read some-
where among some of the J ewish authors (but the place itself
has unhappily slipped from me), that when there was some
pause to be made betwixt the slaying of the sacrifice and the
sprinkling of the blood upon the altar (such a kind of pause
as Moses made when he read to the people the articles of their
covenant), they mingled water with the blood, lest it should
congeal and coagulate. However, the authority is sufficient
that the apostle tells us that the first testament was dedi-
cated by blood and water. The antitype of which is clearly
exhibited in this ratification of the new testament: and
hence it is that the evangelist, by so vehement asseverations,
*confirms the truth of this passage, because it so plainly an-
swers the type, and gives such assurance of the fulfilling
of it.

“That rock was Ohrist‚'' 1 Gor. x. 4. Compare these two
together: Moses smote the rock, and blood and water, saith
the J ew, flowed out thence: the soldier pierced our Saviour's
side with a spear, and water and blood, saith the evangelist,
flowed thence.

St. John concludes this asseveration of his, ἵνα ὑμεῖς πισ-
τεύσητε, that pse miykt believe. ’ It is not without moment what
is commonly said, viZ. that by this flowing out of water and
blood, it is evident his pericardium was pierced; and so there
was an undoubted assuranceg given of his death: but Ihardly
believe the evangelist in this clause had any direct eye towards
it; for would he be so vehement in asserting‚ “He that saw
