ment and disposition of mind, so did they manage their ver-
sion; either adding or curtailing at pleasure, blindly, lazily,
and audaciously enough: sometimes giving a very foreign
sense, sometimes a contrary, ostentimes none: and this fre-
quently to patronise their own traditions, or to avoid some
offenoe they think might be in the original, or for the credit
and safety of their own nation. The tokens of all which
it would not be difficult to instance in very great numbers,
would I apply myself to it, but it is the last only that is my
business at this time.

Talmudists tell us were altered by the LXXII elders when
they wrote out the law (Ι would suppose in Hebrew) for
