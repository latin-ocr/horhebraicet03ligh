156 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xv, 7.

Hoc in loco, Sco. “ In this place the penitam is said to befar
(ff and thejust to be niyh, according to the ancients : but he
that is far off is preferred3 whence they say, The penitente-
are better than the perfectly just. '⁹ As if this obtained
amongst them all as a rule or maxi1n; when indeed the
words of Kimchi are these: “He that is far ff that is, he
that is far off from J erusalenn and lae that is near, that is, he
that is near to Jerusalem. But there is a dispute in the
words of our Rabbins about this matter. ἾΨἿἛ mrumst
ΓΠ '‘pm-12 and some of them ‘interpret it otherw2'se,· for they
expound lzim. that is afar offi as to be understood of the peni-
tent, and him that is near, as meaning thejust .· from whence
they teach and say, That the peniteat are better than those
that- are perfectly just.'’

Some, indeed, that (1ο so expound it, say, that those that
are penitam are to be preferred before those that are the
petfictlffly'zcst, but this was not the common and received opin-
ion of all. Nay, the more general opinion gave so great a
preference to perfect riqltteousness, that repentance was not to
be compared with it. Hence that of R. J ochanan, approved
of by R. Chaijah the great Rabbin‚ that those good and com-
fortable things concerning which the prophete do mention in
their prophecies, belong only to those who were sometimes
wicked men but afterward came unto repentance‚· but they
were far greater things that were laid up for peifectly just per-
sons,—tl1ings which had never been revealed to the prophets,
nor no prophetie eye ever saw, but Orod only 3 things which
were indeed of a higher nature than that they could be made
known to men; for so the Gloss explaineth those words of theirs.

111 this, indeed, they attribute some peculiar excellency to
the penitent; in that, although they had tasted the swcets of
sin, yet they had abandoned it, and got out of the snare:
which it might have been a question whether those that are

perfectly just would have done if they had tasted and expe- ·

rienced the same. But still they esteemed it much nobler
never to have been stained with the pollutione of sin, always
1ο have been just, and never otherwise than good. Nor is it
seldom that we meet with some in the Talmudists making
their own [maske-tion tho subject> of their boast, glorying that
they have never donc· any enorlnoist⁴ thing throughout their
