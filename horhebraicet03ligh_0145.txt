Ve1·.4<³: Ἐφ’ οὓς ἔπεσεν ὁ πύργος ἐν τῷ Σιλωάμ· Upon 'whom
the lower in Siloam falb] The pool of Bathos-cla was the pool
<ff Siloam ,· and from thence all that adjacent part of the city
is deuominated Siloam. And therefore it is left doubtful,
whether this {omer were built over the pool‚ that is, over the
porches of the pooL 01· stood something remote from it in
those parts that yet bore the name of Siloam. And if the
article τῷ does not determine the matter, we must continue
still in doubt. Will grammar permit that that article should
be prefixed to that part of the city? It is certain, that the
very pool is called κολυμβήθρα τοῦ Σιλωὰμ, ther pool of Siloam.
So that I conceive this tower might be built over the porticoes
of the pool, and might overwhelm those eighteen men, while
they were busied about purifying themselves (and so this
event falls in the more agreeably with that of the Galileans),
or as they were expecting to be healed at the troubling of
the waters: for it is very uncertain at what time this tower
fell.

Ver. 7: Ἰδοὺ, τρία ἔτη ἔρχομαι, &a Belzold, these three
years I come, ssoec] There was no tree that was of a kind to
bear fruit might lightly and upon every small occasion be
cut down, that law providing against it in Deut. xx. 19, 203
where the Pasikfa observes that there is both an affirmative
and also a negative command, by which it is the more for-
bidden that any tree of that kind should be cut down,
unless upon a very indispensable occasion. ‘⁶ Rabhs saith,
‘ Out not down the palm that bears a cab of dates? They
urge, ‘ And what of the olive, that that should not be cut
down ζ’ ‘ If it bear but the fourth part os a cab.' R. Cha-

ninah said, &³72 &mmm vm sb& w: rirffiw 2³:12⁷ s&

trae before its time.’'
