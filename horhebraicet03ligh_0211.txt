Oh. xxii. 36, &c.] Exercitations upon St. Lake. ⁶205

Satan is so hot against all of you? And whilst you are at
strife amongst yourselves‚ he is at strife against you all!’'
Under such a notion as this I doubt not our Saviour did
speak to Peter, and that in these words he found a severe
reprimand rather than any promotion to the primacy.

Ver. 32: Ἵνα μὴ ἐκλείπῃ ἡ πίστις σου· ΤῘιαί thy saith fail
not] There seems an emphasis in the word πίστις, saith. As
to the other apostles‚ indeed, that Christian courage and mag-
nanimity which they ought to have exerted in that difficult time
did fail them3 but their ficitlc was nothing so near shipwreck
as Peter’s saith was. They indeed deserted their Master and
fied, Mark xiv. 50 : which they seem to have not done without
some connivance from himself, John xviii. 8. But when Peter
renounced and abjured his Lord‚ how near was he becoming
ἾὩἾΨῺ an apostata and his saith from suffering a total ship-
wreck? Certainlyk it was Peter's advantage that Christ prayed
for him3 but it was not so much for his honour, that he, be-
yond all others, should stand in need of such a prayer.

Ver. 36 : Πωλησάτω τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀγορασάτω μάχαιραν·

give them this counsel in good earnest?

1. He uses the common dialect. For so also the Rabbins
in other things: “ He¹ that hath not wherewithal to eat, but
upon mere alms‚ let him beg or sel] his garments to buy oil
and candles for the feast of Dedication,’' Sco.

II. He warns them of a danger that is very near3 and in a
common way of speech lets them know that they had more
need of providing swords for their defence against the com-
mon enemy, than be any way quarrelling amongst themselves,
Not so much exhortingm them to repel force with force, as to
give them such an apprehension of the common rage of their
enemies against them, that might suppress all private ani-
mosities amongst themselves.

Ver. 37 : Καὶ γὰρ τὰ περὶ ἐμοῦ τέλος ἔχει· For the thinqs con-
cerninq me have an end] That is, “My business is done,
yours is but beginning. While I was present, the children
of the bridechamber had no reason to weep3 but when I am
taken away, and numbered amongst the transgressors, think
