Ver. 35: ’Έτι τετράμηνόυ ἐστι, καὶ ὁ θερισμὸς ἕρχεται’ There
are yet fom- -mom‘lzs, and then comem harvest] The begin-
ning of the harvest [that is7 the barley-harvest] was about the
middle of the month Nisam, Consult Lev. xxiii. 10, &c. Deut.
xvi. 9.

“ Halfu Tisri, all lX'Iarchesvam and half Chisleu, is zm the
seed time. Half Chisleu, whole Tebeth, and half Shnhat, is
ι’]ἾἸΠ the winter. Half Shebat, whole Adar, and half Nisan, is
ἾἸῙ) the winvteaf· solstr'ee. Half Nisam, all J yar, and half Sivan‚
is 5⁵2? the harvest. Half Sivan, all ΤΞ111111112ἢ and half Ab, is
ΫἾᾫ the summer. Half Ab, all EluL and half Tisri, is ΟἾΠ
the yreat beas* ’

Theyx sowed the wheat and spclt in the month Tisri, and
Marchesvan‚ and so onwarcl. Targ. upon Eccles. xi. 23 ‘³ Give
a good portion of thy seed to thy field in the month Tisri, and
withhold thou not from sowing also in Chi-deus*

They sowed barley in the months Shebat ancl Adar.

NEC& y &37³3 The latewardz seed, or that which is hid and
lieth long in the earth3 “ the wheat and the spelt which do
not soon ripen, are sown in Marchesvam ΝΞἾΠ mm the
early seed, the barley, which soon ripens, is sown in Shebat
and Adar.'’

“ Theya sow severity days before the Passover.'’

The barley, therefore, the hope of a harvest to come after
four months, was not yet committed to the ground 3 and yet
our Saviour saith, ‘⁶ Behold the fields are already white unto
the harvest.’' Which thing being a little observed‚ will help
to illustrate the words and design of our Lord. “ Lift up your
eyes (saith he) and look upon the fieldsss' &e pointing without
doubt towards that numerous crowd of people, that at that
time flocked towards him out of the city3 q. d. “ ssehold, what
a harvest of souls is here, where there had been no sowing
beforehand.' '
