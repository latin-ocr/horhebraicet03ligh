from the Greek original, but from this story :

“ Uponk a certain timel, all Israel ascended up to Jerusa-
lem to the feast„ and there wanted water for them. Nicode-
mus Ben Gorion eomes to a great man, and prays him, saying,
‘ Lend me twelve wells of water, for the use of those that, are
to come up to the feast, and I will give you back twelve wells

and they appointed a day. When the day of payment came,
and it had not yet rained, Nicodamus went to a little oratory,
and covered himself, and prayed: and of a sudden the clouds
gathered‚ and a plentiful rain descended, so that twelve wells
were filled, and a great deal over. The great man eavilled
that the day was past, sor the sun was set: Nicodemus goes
into his oratory again, covers himself and prayS‚ and the
clouds dispersing themselves5 the sun breaks out again.
