Let us take a little taste of the way of consolation they
used : “ Theu Rabbins deliver. then the sons of R. Ishmael
died, four of the elders went in to him to comfort him; viz.
R. Tarphon, and R. Jose the Galilean‚ and R. Eliezer Ben
Azariah, and R. Akibah. R. Tarphon saith unto them, ‘ Ye
must know that this is a very wise man, well skilled in expo-
sition. Let not any of you interrupt the words of his fellow.'
Saith R. Akibah‚ ‘ Ι am the last? R. Ishmael began and said³⁹
[the mourner here breaks silence} ‘⁶ ‘ His iniquities are multi-
plied, his griefs have bound him, and he hath wearied his
masters? Thus he said once and again. Then answered R.
Tarphon and said, ‘ It is said, And your brethren of the house
of Israel shall bewail the burning‚ Levit. x. 6. May we not
argue from the less to the greater? If Nadab and Abihu, who
never performed but one command, as it is written, And the
sons of Aaron brought blood to him; then much more may
the sons of R. Ishmael be bewailed.' R. Jose the Galilean
answered, saying, ⁶ All Israel shall mourn for him and bury
him,5 1 Kings xiv. 13. And must we not argue from the greater
to the less? If they wept so for Abijah the son of J eroboam,
who did but one good thing, as it is said, Because in him
there is found some good thing ; how much more for the sons
of R. Ishmael !' '³ Of the same nature are the words of
R. Eliezer and R. Akibah: but this is enough, either to raise
laughter‚ or make a man angry. In the same page we have
several forms of speech used by the women, that either'were
the mourners or the comforters. As,
