been no difficulty3 but being said througfh the miclst ofSamaria
and Galilee, it raiseth that doubt to which I have formerly
spoken, viz. whether tlcrozcylz ‘ Galilee? in this place, ought
not to be understood tlwouyk ⁶ Perea? The Syriae and
Arabic seem to have been aware of this difficulty3 and
therefore, to accommodate the matter, have rendered διὰ
μέσου, tlcrouylb the midst, by ΓΞ, between.- in which significa-
tion ἆυᾶ μέσον is very familiar in Greek authors. So that
the sense they seem to make of it is this: that J esus in his
journey to Jerusalem took his way in the very extreme
borders os Galilee and Samaria, i. e. that ke went between the
confines, and, as it were, upon the very brink of each country
for a good way together. He did, indeed, go to the Scytho-
politan bridge, by which he passed over into Perea: but
whether διὰ μέσου will allow of such a rendering, let the more
skilful judge.

Ver. 12: Δέκα λεπροὶ ἄνδρες· Ten men that were ἔθρεψε]

leper shall dwell alone, and without the camp.'' How then
came these ten to converse thus together? as also those four
together, 2 Kings vii. 33

must not live with kim.- i. e. those that are unclean by other
kind of defilements : which also is intimated by the Gemarists
in these words: ‘⁴ Shall those that have their issues, and
those that are defiled by the dead, be sent out into one and
the same place? The text saith, ‘They shall not defile their
camps,' Numbers v. 3; to assign one camp for these, and
another for them.''

The Zepers might be conversant with lepers, and those that
had issues with those that had issue-33 but those that were
under different defilements might not converse promiscu-
ously. Which confirms what I have conceived concerning
the five porches at the pool of Bethesda; viZ„ that- they
were so framed and distinguished at first, that there might
be a different reception for those that had contracted dif-
ferent kinds of defilements‚ and were there waiting to be
cleansed in that pool.
