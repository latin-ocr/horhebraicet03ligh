346 Hebrew and Talmudicoel [Ch. ix, 34.

Ver. 34: Καὶ ἐξέβαλον αὐτὸν ἔξω· And they east him out]
I shall not-e something of t-his kind of phrase at chap.. xvi. 2.
Thus doth this man commence the first confessor in the Christ-
ian church, as John the Baptist had been the first martyr in
it. He suffered excommunic-atim, and that from the whole
congregation of Israel, for the name of Christ. It seems
something strange that they did not excommunicate Jesus
himself: but they were contriving more bloody things against
him.

AMONGST all the places in the Old Testament which mention
this great Shepherd‚ there is no one doth so exaetly describe
him and his pastoral work, as chap. xi. of the prophet Zecha-
riah. We will fetch a few things from thence, that may serve
to explain the passage now in hand :

I. He describes this great Shepherd manifesting himself,
and applying himself to his great pastoral office, when the
nation was now upon the brink of destruction: the prophet
had foretold their ruin„ and brings in this Shepherd under-
taking the care of his sheep, lest they should pei-ish too.

As to the first verse, “ Open thy doors, O Lebanon 3⁵⁹ take
the Jews’ own comment upon it, who yet do, by all the skill
they can, endeavour to take off the whole prophecy from those
proper hinges upon which it turns.

“Fortyf years before the destruction [of Jerusalem] the
gates of the Temple opened themselves of their own accord.
Rabban J ochanan Ben Zacchai declaimed upon it [objmyavz't
portas]‚ saying, ‘ O Temple, Temple, why dost thou terrify
thyself? I know thy end will be destruction 3 sor so Zechariah,
the son of Iddo, hath prophes'Ied concerning thee; Open thy
doors, O Lebanon,' '' δια.

The rest that follows doth plainly enough speak out deso-
lation and ruin, ver. 2, 3 : but particularly that is remarkable,
ver. 6, “I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's
hand :²² how manifestly doth it agree with those intestine
broils and discords, those horrid seditions, stirred up aniongst
them! “And into the hand of his king ;'’ i. e. of Caesar, con-

cerning whom they may renieniber they once said, “ We have
no king but Oaesarst
