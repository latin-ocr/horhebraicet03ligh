Oh. xviii. 38.] Exercitations upon Si.⁴ John. 529

since the time that they had removed out of GaxitIm and so
might the easilier persuade Pilate in that case. But their great
design was to throw off the odium of Christ's death from
themselves, at least amongst the vulgar crowd, fearing them,
if the council themselves should have decreed his execution.
They seek this evasion, therefore, whichx did not altogether
want some colour and pretext of truth: and it succeeded ac-
cording to what they did desire; Divine Providence so order·
ing it, as the evangelist intimates, ver. 32, “ That the saying

irath? that is, “ What is the true state of this affair? that
thou, who art so poor a wretch, shouldst call thyself a king,
and at the same time that thou callest thyself a king, yet
sayest thy kingdom is not of this world? Where lies the truc

But supposing when Christ said, he came “that he should
