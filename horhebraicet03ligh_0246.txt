240 Hebrew and Talmudical [Ch. i. 5, 810.

Ver. 5: Καὶ τὸ φῶς ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ φαίνει· And tlae Ziylct skineth
in darkness] This liqlzt of promise and life by Christ skined
in the darkness of all the oloudy types and shadows under the
law and obscurity of the prophets. And those dark things
‘comprehended it Ποῖ] i. e. did not so cloud and suppress it
but it would break out3 nor yet so comprehended it, but that
there was an absolute necessity there should a greater light
appear. I do so much the rather incline to such a paraphrase
upon this place, because Ι observe the evangelist here treateth
of the ways and means by which Christ made himself known
to the world before his great manifestation in the flesh; first,
in the promise of life, ver. 43 next, by types and prophecies ;
and lastly, by John Baptist.

Ver. 9¹⁹³: Ὂ φωτίζει πάντα ἄνθρωπον ἐρχόμενον εἰς τὸν κόσμον·
ΠῙΙιέοΙι lifslcteth, every man that cometlc into the world] *⁵242 ³7:
0³7²& i. e. All the men that are in tlte worldl. ‘⁶ Doth not the

sun rise [3³va *3³22 ³72 ἓν upon all that come into the world ‚9'’

0373? ³2³2: ³¹22 “All that come into the world are not able to
make one fly¹¹¹.” ‘⁴ In the beginning of the year, 0³:537 Ἴδῃ ³7:
all that come into the world present themselves before the
Lordn.” There are numberless examples of this kind. The
sense of the place is, that Christ, shining forth in the light of
the gospel‚ is a light that Zz‘gylctens all the world. The light of
the law shone only upon the J ews; but this light spreads
wider, even over the face of the whole earth.

Ver. 12: ’Έὸωκεν αὐτοῖς ἐξουσίαν· He φανῶ them power]
κἙξουσιίισεν αὐτοῖς, He empowered them, so Eccles. V. 19, and
vi. 2. He gave them the privileg& the liberty, the difflzity, of
being called and becoming the sons of God. Israel was
once the son and the first-born, Exod. iv. 22: but now the
adoption of sons to God was open and free to all nations
whatever.

Ver. ¹3 : Οἳ οὐκ ἐξ αἱμάτων· Which were born, not of blood]
It may be a question here, whether the evangelist in this place
opposeth regeneration to natural generation‚ or only to those
ways by which the Jews faneied men were made the sons of
God. Expositors treat largely of the former: let us a little
consider the latter.
