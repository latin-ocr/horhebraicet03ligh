mean by mammon ossalsolcoocl, 01· mammon of „oo-iykteousuess.
They themselves explain it, when they render it sometimes by
ww& ῙὫΞὉ mammon of vz'olencex; sometimes by ὩἮἿἾ ἶἾῒΞΌ
mammon of wiekednessy. Kimehi2, by ³732 ‘7127 *0272 mammon
ofrapine, upon Isa. xxxiii.

By the way, I cannot but observe, that that expression,
Hosea v, 11, 'lg ³15]ss after the commandmont, i. e. of Jero-

boam or Omri, is rendered by the Targumists ‘mm wrm
ἾῦζζΠ after the mammon offalselcood. W⁷here also see the
Greek and Vulgar.

Seeing it appears therefore that μαμωνᾶ ἀδικίας, the mam-
mon of nnff'iolcteousn638‚ is the same in the Greek with ΠΝ)
“xpm-1 in the Targumists‚ who speak in the common language
of that nation, there is no reason why it should not be taken
here in the very same sense. Think but what word our
Saviour would use to express ἀδικίας by, and then thi11k³,if
there can be any word more probable than that which was so
well known, and so commonly in use in that nation. The
Syriae hath it &³752 which doth not in the least diminish
the sense of the other. Indeed the word ἄδικος, in this place,
is softened by some, that it should denote no further than
false, as not true and substantial: so that the μαμωνᾶ ἀδικίας
should signify deceitful mammon, not opposing rickes well 9⁰2
to those that are ill 905, but opposing eartkly riches to spi-
ritual .· which rendering of the word took its rise from hence
especially, that it looked ill and unseemly, that Christ should
persuade any to make to themselves friends by giving alms
out of an ill-gotten estate: not to mention that, ver. 1 1, ἄδικος,
,αηνὶρῖιτεοαε mammon, is opposed τῷ ἀληθινῷ, to trae riohes.

III. It is not to be doubted but that the disciples of Christ
did sufficiently abhor the acquiring of riches by fraud and
rapine: but can we absolve all of them from the guile of it
before their conversion? particularly Matthew the publican‘?
And is it so very unseemly for our Saviour to admonish them
to make themselves friends by restituam, and a pious distri-
bution of those goods they may have unjustly gathered before
their conversion? The discourse is about restitution, and not
yiviny of abms.
