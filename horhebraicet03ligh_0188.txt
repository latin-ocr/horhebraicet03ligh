182 Hebraeo and Talmudical [Oh. xvii. 20.

It is plain to every eye, that the cutting-off os that place
and nation is emphatically called his kinydom, and his cominy
in ylory. Nor indeed without reason: for before he wasted
the city and subverted that nation, he had subdued all nations
under the empire and obedience of the gospe13 according to
what he foretold, “ Thati the gospel of the kingdom should
be preached in all the world, and then should the end [of
Jerusalem] come.'' And when he had obtained his dominion
amongst the Gentiles, what then remained towards the con-
summation of his kinydom and victories, but to cut off his
enemies the Jews, who would not that he should 11110 ον01·
them? Of this lcinydom of God he speaks in this place, not
answering according to that vain apprehension the Pharisee
had when he propounded the question, but according to the
thing itself and the truth of it. There are two things he saith
of this kinydom .·

1. Thatk it comes not μετὰ παρατηρήσεως, with observation.
Not but that it might be seen and conspicuous, but that they
would not see and observe it. Which security and supineness
of theirs he both soretells and taxeth in other places once and
again. ‚

2. He further tells them, βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐντὸς ὑμῶν ἐστι,
this hingrdom of Gocl is within you .· you are the scene of these
triumphs. And whereas your expectancies are of that kind,
that you say, Behold here a token of the Messias in the sub-
duing of such a nation, and, Behold there in the subduing
of another, they will be all in vain, for, ἐντὸς ὑμῶν ἐστι,
it is witlw'n s‘lOu'· within, ancl upon your own nation, that these

· things must be done. Ι would lay the emphasis in the word

ὑμῶν, you, when commonly it is laid in ἐντὸς, within.

Besides, those things which follow, ver. 22, do very much
confirm it, that Christ speaks of the kingdom of God in that
sense wherein we have supposed it: they are spoken to his
disciples “ that the days will come, wherein they shall desire
to see one of the days of the Son of man, but shall not see 11.”
(Ημέραι τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, clm days ef the ›S'on ofmcm, in
the -Jewish style, are ΠἻΕῺΠ fluv, the days of the Messias:
days, wherein they promise themselves nothing but pleasing,
