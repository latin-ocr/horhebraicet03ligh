Oh. iv. 27.] Exercitations upon St. Lake. 75

in part answers to the J ews’ Marchesvan: for consult that
passage, chap. xviii. [5]; ‘⁶ Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into
the land unto all the fountains of water, and unto all brooks :
peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules
alive.” No one will say this search was made in the winter,
but in the summer: not before or in the month Nisan, wherein
the rains were wont to fall; for what hay or grass could be ex-
pected at that time? But when the year grew on to the sum-
mer, then was it a seasonable time to inquire after hay and
grass. Reckon therefore the time of Ahab's and Obadiah’s
progress in this search: the time wherein Elijah and Obadiah
meeting together, Ahab fell in with them: the time wherein
the Israelites and the prophets of Baal were gathered toge-
ther at mount Oarme13 when Elijah sacrificed there, and the
followers of Baal were killed: and certainly it will be more
probable that the unlocking of the heavens and 1116 fall of the
rains happened in that usual and ordinary season, the month
Marchesvan‚ than any 011161· part of the year. Three years
agone, in that month when 1116 161116 were expected, according
to the common season of the year, Elijah shut heaven up that
it should 1101 rain: and now at the close of three years, when
the season for those rains recurred, he unlocks the heavens
ancl the rains fall abundantly.

VI. Now, go back from Marchesvan, the month wherein
the prophet locked up heaven, to the mouth Nisan preceding,
and those six months between, they were also without rain,
according 10 1116 ordinary course of the year and climate. In the
month Nisan it rained 3 the rest of the year 10 Marchesvan it
was fair and held up : when that 111011111 661116 1116 161116 were
expected 3 but Elijah had shut the heavens up, and they re-
mained shut up for the space of three years ensuing. So that
though he did not shut up heaven above the space of three
years, yet there was no rain for three years and six months.

examples3 especially if we consider the occasion upon which
our Saviour brought them. ‘ Thou hast wrought miracles in
Capernaum3 do something also here in thine own city.’ ‘ No,
you are unworthy of it, as Israel of old was unworthy of the
