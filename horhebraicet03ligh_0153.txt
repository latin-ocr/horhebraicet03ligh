doth recite, let him but hear attentively, and ho <loth as
much as is required from him.

III. There was a twofold way of responding according to
the difference of persons reciting. If an elder, or master of a
family, or one that could fitly represent the whole congrega—
tion, should recite or lead in singing3 then the rest repeat no
other words after him except ΞὫἾΞΠ ἫῊἾ tlm first clause
of every Psalm3 and as to all the remainder, they answered
verse by verse Hallelujah. For the action of him that repre—
sented them, and led up in singing, availed for those that
were represented, especially they having testified their consent
by answering Hccllelssqjah. He was a dunce, indeed, that could
not answer so far amongst the rest.

IV. But if there wanted such an elder so well skilled in
reading or reciting, that it became necessary for a servant
or woman, or some more skilful boy, to lead, [φησίπᾶν-θη] then
let us hear what they did in that casel: “ Ify a servant, or
woman, or boy should lead in singing, 3:712) ΠΒ Vtram& mnu*
[3an every one in the conyreqatz'on recites those very words
which he had said : 3757] ΠἾΠ 02⁸2, ‘cf a more ancient person,

or one of φθαῖεν note, do sing or read, ΠἾἾζῬΒΠ ἾἾἾΠΝ mm
they answer after him ⁶ Halklujah' Now the reason why the

words recitedZ by a servant, woman, or boy should be re—
peated after them verbatim, was this, because such a one was
unfit to represent a congregation, and his action could not
avail for the rest: so that it. behoved every person to recito
singly for himself, that he might perform his duty.

V. When they came to the words now in hand, ζέε-ΞΓ] ΤΓΙἾΞΤ,

cometh‚· and the rest answer, In the hamc of the Lord. And
this is that for which I have so long ventured upon the
reader's patience, that he may observe what is done dif-
ferently from the rest when this clause is recited. It is cut
in th which is not done in others. And the first words are
not repeated after the praecentor, as they are in other clauses,
