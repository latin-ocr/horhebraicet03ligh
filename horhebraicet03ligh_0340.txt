Ver. 33: Σπέρμα Ἀβραάμ ἐσμεν, &Q W'e be Abraham's
seed, &cst They were wont to glory of being Abraham's seed
beyond all measure. Take one instance of a thousand:

“ Ity is storied of R. Jochanan Ben Matthias, that he said
to his son, ‘ Gro out and hire us some labourers.' He went
out and hired them for their victuals. W'hen he came home
to his father, his father said to him, ‘ My son, though thou
shouldst make feasts for them, as gaudy as the feasts of Solo-
mon, thou wouldst not do enough for them, because they are

the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.⁹” And yet

· they confess mm& ΠὉῖ nnn “the merz'ts of our fathers

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ceased from the days of Hosea
the prophet, as saith Rabh 3 or as Samuel, from the days of
Hazael.’'

But how came they to join this, “ We be Abraham's seed,
and were never in bondage to any man 3²² Is it impossible
that one of Abraham's seed should be in bondage? The sense
of these two clauses must be distinguished z “We are of the
seed of Abraham, who are very fond and tenacious of our
liberty 3 and as far as concerns ourselves, we· never were in
bondage to any man.” The whole nation was infinitely averse
to all servitude, neither was it by any means lawful for an
Israelite to sell himself into bondage, unless upon the ex-
tremest necessity.

“Ita is not lawful for an Israelite to sell himself for that
end merely, that he might treasure up the moneyb, or might
trade with it, or buy vessels, or pay a creditor; but barely
if he want food and sustenance. Nor may he sell himself,
unless when nothing in the world is left, not so much as his
clothes, then let him sell himself. And he whom the Sanhedrim
sells, or sells himself, must not be sold &mDDl &³75 ΝἾΒΠἾΞΞ
openly, ozor in tlze public way, as other slaves are sold, but
privately.’'

Ver. 37: Ἀλλὰ ζητεῖτε’ με ἀποκτεῖναι· But ye seelc ίο kill
me] From this whole period it is manifest that the whole
tendency of our Saviour’s discourse is to shew the Jews that
they are the seed of that serpent that was to brnise the heel
of the Messiah: else what could that mean, ver. 44, ‘⁵ Ye are
