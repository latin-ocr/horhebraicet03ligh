Uh. xxi. 212] Exercitations upon St. John. 453

ΙΙ. With reference to this, and under this notion, the
times immediately preceding this ruin are called ‘ the last
days,' and the last times, ΞἿζοῖζῖ ΠῚἿΠὲζ; that is, the last
times of the J ewish city, nation, economy. This manner of
speaking frequently occurs: which let our St. John himself
interpret, 1 John ii. 18 3 “ ‘ There are many antichriste 3
whereby we know that it is the last time :' and that this
nation is upon the very verge of destruction, when as it hath
already arrived at the utmost pitch of infidelity, apostasy‚ and
wickedness.’'

ΙΙΙ. With the same reference it is, that the times and
state of things immediately following the destruction of J eru-
salem are called ‘ a new creation: ‘new heavens,' and ‘a new
earth,' Isa. lxv. 173 “Behold‚ I create a new heaven and a
new earth.'' When should that be? Read the whole chapter;
and you will find the Jews rejected and cut off 3 and from
that time is that new creation of the evangelical world among
the Gentiles.

Compare 2 Cor. v. 17 and Rev. xxi. 1, 23 where, the old
Jerusalem being cut off and destroyed, a new one succeeds;
and new heavens and a new earth are created.

2 Pet. iii. 13 : “ We, according to his promise, look for new
heavens and a new earth.’' The heavens and the earth of the
J ewish church and commonwealth must be all on sire, and the
Mosaic elements burnt up : but we, according to the promise
made to us by Isaiah the prophet, when all these are consumed‚
look for the new creation of the evangelical state.

IV. The day, the time, and the manner of the execution of
this vengeance upon this people are called, ‘ the day of the
Lord,' ‘ the day of Christ,’ ‘ his coming in the clouds, in his
glory, in his kingdom? Nor is this without reason3 for from
hence doth this form and mode of speaking take its rise:

Christ had not as yet appeared but in a state of humility;
· contemned‚ blasphemed, and at length murdered by the Jews:
his gospel rejected, laughed at, and trampled under soot : his
followers pursued with extreme hatred, persecution‚ and death
itself. At length, therefore, he displays himself in his glory,
his kingdom, and power3 and calls for those cruel enemies of
his, that they may be slain before him.

Acts ii. 20: “ Before that great and notable day of the
