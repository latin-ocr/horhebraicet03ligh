164 Hebrem and Talmudical [Ch. xvi. 12, 16.

that, let us judge from the example of Zaccheus: although
he was not faithful in scraping together any thing unjustly,
yet was he eminently faithful in so piously distributing it.

Ver. 12: Εἰ εἰ) τῷ ἀλλοτρίῳ πιστοὶ οὐκ ἐγένεσθε, Sco. If ye
have not been faithful in that which was another man's, ξφα] To
apply τὸ ἀλλότριοι), another man's, to that wealth which is
given us by God, is something harsh and obscure3 but to
apply it to the riches of other men, makes the sense a little
more easy: “ If ye have been unjust in purloining the goods
of other men, and will still as unjustly keep them back, what
reason have you to think that others will not deal as unjustly
with you, and keep back even what is yours3'’

Ver. 16 ε Καὶ πᾶς εἷς αὐτὴν βιάζεται· And every one pressetlz
into ia] These words may be varied into a sense plainly con-
trary; so far that they may either denote the entertainment
or the persecution of the gospel. Quivis in illud vi perrumpit,
saith Beza : Every one breaketh into it by force‚· which points
at the former sense of these words. Vulg. Quivis in illud
vim facit: Every one commits violence upon it.- which points to
the latter. I have admitted of the former, as that which is
the most received sense of that passage in Matt. xi. 12 ε but
the latter seems more agreeable in this place, if you will sup-
pose a continued discourse in our Saviour from ver. 15, and
that one verse depends upon another. They do indeed seem
independent‚ and incoherent one with another; and yet there
is no reason why we may not suppose a connexion, though at
the first view it is not so perspicuous. We may observe the
manner of the schools in this very difficulty. In both the
Talmuds‚ what frequent transitione are there infinitely obscure
and inextricable at first sight, and seemingly of no kind of
coherence; which yet the expositore have made very plain
and perspicuous, very coherent with one another.

Ι would therefore join and continue the discourse in some
such way as this: “ You Zauyh me to scorn f, and have my
doctrine in derision‚ boasting yourselves above the sphere
of it, as if nothing Ι said belonged at all to you. Nor do Ι
wonder at it; for whereas the Law and the Prophets were
‘until John, yet did you deal no otherwise with them, but
changed and wrested them at your pleasure by your tradi-
