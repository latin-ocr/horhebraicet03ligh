Ch. xx. ρῳ] ΕευθνσίίατὼΊω upon St. Jolm. 447

stles only: and I know nowhere, if not in the words we are
now treating of, from whence otherwise the original of this
power and authority can be derived.

ΙΙΙ. It seems further, that at this very time was granted
to the apostles a commission to confer the Holy Spirit 011
those whom they found qualified‚ and that in these words,
“Receive ye the Holy Ghost:” i.e. “ Receive ye it to dis-
tribute it to others.” For although it cannot be denied but
that they received the Holy Ghost for other reasons also, and
to other ends, of which we have already discoursed3 yet is
not this great end to be excluded, which seemed the highest
and noblest endowment of all, viZ. that Christ breathing upon
thern inspired them with the Holy Ghost, with this mighty
authority and privilege, that they should be capable of dis-
pensing it to others also.

Ver. 24: Θωμᾶς, ὁ λεγόμενος Δίδυμος, οὐκ ἢν μετ’ αὐτῶν·
But Thomas, called Didymus, was not with thena] Ι. The evan-
gelist does not here, as the writers of lexicons, render the sig-
nification of a Hebrew name into Greek, when he tells us,
“ Thomas is also called Didymus;'' but only lets us know that as
he was called Thomas among the Hebrews, so was he called
Didymus among the Greeks. There is not another amongst
the twelve apostles of whom this is said. Simon indeed is
called Peter 3 but these are really too distinct names: so was
Nathanael called Bartholomew: but Thomas and Didymus
both one name, of one signification in different languages.
Perhaps Thomas was born in some place where the Jews and
the Greeks promiscuously inhabited: such a place was the
region.of Decapolis; and so by the Hebrews he might be
called by his Hebrew name, and the Greek by the Greeks.

II. The disciples had all fied and were dispersed when
Christ was apprehended, Mark xiv. 50, except Peter and John.
Whence it is said in ver. 2 of this chapter, that Mary Mag-
dalene came to Peter, and ‘⁶ to the other disciple,X whom J esus
loved ;’' for she knew where she might find theom and so she
could not for the rest. And thus scattered, as it should seem,
they passed over the sabbath day3 but when they heard that
their Lord was risen, then they begin to associate again.
