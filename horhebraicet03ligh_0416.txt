was the great business he had to do in this world, to pay
such an obedienee, and to fulfil such a righteousness; and
this righteousness is the principal and noble theme and sub-

must primarily and of necessity be convinced and instructed
to the glory of him that justifieth, and the declaration of the
true doctrine of justification. And this righteousness of his
was abundantly evidenced by his going to the Father, because
