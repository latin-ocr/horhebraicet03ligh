Ι. It may be answered that this was perhaps by a Hebrew
idiotismg by which tlte way, the trum, and the life, may be
the same with the true aad living] ways.

Jer. xxix. 11: ,72an Wssfflss 0:³²2 rit-7³? To yiee you om
end ancl hope, or expectation .· that is, a hoped or expected end.
So Kimchi in loe.; ‘³ A good end even as you expect.”

II. Our Saviour seems to refute that opinion of the Jews
concerning their law, as if it were the way, the truth, and the
life, and indeed every thing: and to assert his own authority
and power of introducing a new rule of religion, because him-
self is the way, the trutlz, and tlw life, in a sense much
more proper and more sublime than the law could be said
to be.

It had been happier for the J ew if he could have discerned
more judiciously concerning the law ; if he could have distin-
guished between coming to Grod in the law and coming to
God by the law: as also between living in the law and living
by the law, It is beyond all doubt, there is no way of coming
to God but ἐπ his law: for what outlaw, 01· one that still
wanders out of the paths of God's commandments, can come
unto him? So also it is impossible that any one should have
life but in the law of God. For who is it can have life that
doth not wall( according to the rule of his laws? But to obtain
admission to the favour of God by the law, and to have life by
the law; that is, to be justified by the works of the law; this
sounds quite another thing: for it is by Christ only that we
live and are justified; by him alone that we have access to
God.

These are the fictions of the Rabbins: “ There was one
shewed a certain R-abbin the place where Corah and his com-
pany were swallowed up, and, ‘ Listen,' saith he, ‘ what they
say.' So they heard them saying, rm& maim mvn llsoses
and his law are the trutlc. Upon the ealends of every month
hell rolls them about, as flesh rolls in the caldron, hell still
saying, nn& ἾΠἾἾΠἾ rium Moses ancl lais law are truthn.”

It is, indeed, a great trutli, what is uttered in this most
