01· (52212392’06'1251 .· foi· by that word ΠρἾἻῖζ riyhteousness, the
Jews usually expresses] chemise] 01· almsyiviny, as every one
that hath dipped into that language knows very well. And
then his meaning might be, make to 90111181ῦῖ06β’·ἰεηίῖε of tlte
mammon of unm'ylzteousness, i. e. of those richcs which you
have not yet laid out in 71ρῆῆέ νὶῃῖιΐεοῖιεηεεε, 01· almsyiviny.
But it is beyond my understanding to think what one word
he could express ἀδικίαυ by in this sense.

ΙΙΙ. I see no reason, therefore, why we may not, nay, why,
indeed, it- is not necessary to, understand the words precisely
of rienes ill glottam For,

1. So the application of the parable falls in directly with
the parable itself : “ That steward gained to himself friends
by ill-gotten goods3 8ο do ye: make to yourselves friends
of the w'ealth you have not well got.'’

Object. But far be it from cnr Saviour to exhort 01· en-
courage any 10 get riches unjustlyq or 10 8111· 1110111 up to give
alnis out of what they have dishonestly aequired. Nemo non
fatebitur, saith Heinsius3 ‘⁴ No man but will confess our Lord
meant nothing less than that any 0110 should make friends
to himself of richcs unjustly gained.'' Yet, for all this, I
must acknowledge mysclf not so very well satisfied in this
matter.

2. Let 118 but a little consider by what words in the Syriae
our Saviour might express μαμωνᾶ ἀδικίας, especially if he
spoke in the vulgar language. It was a common phrase,
ἾῙἍΠἾ ζἸὮιὮ mammon offalsity, 01· false mammon ‚· at least if
the Targumists speak in the vulgar idiom of that nation,
which none will deny. 11 18 said of Samuer sons, that
‘¹ they did not wall< in 1118 ways *pm-¹ ῙἾῸὈ nnn *lbvnfflwffi
but turned after ‘false mammon Γ) “ He destroys his own
house, &pm-1 ῙἿὮὩ ΨΞΞὩ whoso hoaps up to himself the ‘ mam-
mon of falsekood⁵.'” “ Whoever walks in justice, and speaketh
right things, '¹pr FUBD ΡἾΠἾΓὩΞἾ, and separatas himseff
from ‘the mammon of iniquitgst.'” “ To shed blood and to
destroy 801118ἳ ἾρωἾ '‘an &³7:375 ‘7572 that they may yain
‘ mammon of falselzood u.' ’'

There needs no commentator 10 shew what the Targumists
