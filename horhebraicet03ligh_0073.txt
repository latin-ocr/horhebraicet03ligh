Oh. iv. 16.] Erercitatc'ons ‘upon st. Lake. ’ 67

we may franie the better judgment of this aetion of our
Saviour's‚ let us a little look into the eustoms of the syna-
gogue:——-

I. They read stcmcliny up. Piska mear-3: and Rabbenu'd
Asher; “ They do not read in the law otherwise than stand-
ing) up. Nay, it is unlawful for him that readeth to lean
upon any thing. Whenee eomes it that he that readeth in
the law is bound to stcmd up? Rabh Abhu saith, Because
the Scripture saith, Do thou stand by me. Nor ought any ,
one to lean anyb way, as it is in the Jerusalem. R. Samuel
Bar Isaac going into a synagogue found one expounding and
leaning against a pillar. He saith to him, This is not lawsul:
for as the law was given with reverence, so are we to handle
it with reverenee too.’'

They preferred the Lam before the „Propheta and the Lau>
and the Propkess above the Hagyioqraplea„ or leolys ‘corifitzsssc .-
and yet they yielded that honour to the Prophets, that even
they should not be read but standing up. Whence that is
particular which they say coneerning the Book of Estherd,
“ A man may read out of the Book of Esther, either standing
or sitting. But not so out of the law? Christ in this fol-
lowed the customs of the synagogue, in that while he read
the Law he stood up, while he taught it he sat down.

ΙΙ. He that read in the Prophets was called *nmen
implear,- and was appointed to that office by the ruler of
the synagogue„

“ Rabhe Bibai was a great man ΝᾫΞζῖ] *trba 3³³3>ss in
takinq care of the tlaz'nys qf God. And Mar was a great man
&RD '‘DUX-5. 3553737 in talem-9 care of the tlainys of the tow72.''
The Gloss is: ‘⁶ Of the things of efod, that is, about the col-
leotors of the alms, and the distribution of it, ῙὊὮἎἾΓἹΌ rim
priami and the order-inq those that were to expozmd and read
the Prophets.''

It is probable that Christ did at this time offer himself
as a Maphtir, οι· as one that would read in the Prophets, and
preach upon what he read3 not beforehand appointed to it
by the ruler of the synagogue, but rather approved of when
