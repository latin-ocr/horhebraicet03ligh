bath, then doth the Passover fall in with the sabbath too:
and then let them begin to number from the going out of the
sabbath, and the weeks will be complete according to the
days of the creation. He takes an instance from J oshua and
Shecaniah. For there were twenty-four courses‚ which took
their turns alternately every sabbath: amongst which J oshua
was the ninth‚ and Shecaniah the tenth. On the first week
of the month Nisan, Jehoiarib was the first course; on the
second week J edaiah3 ΠἹἾῑῖ] nannum& ‘72 ΠΟΞ ‘7³2⁷ Πζῑῐῖ]
οη the paschal week, allm the courses amended toyether. The six
weeks to that sabbath that immediately preceded the Pente-
cost, there ministered six courses‚ Harim, Seorim, Malchijah,
Mijamin, Hakkos, Abiah. In the sabbath that precedes the
pentecost, J oshua enters, but does not attend till after Pen-

Passover and Pentecost : for if J oshua was between the Pass-
over and pentecost, the weeks would not be complete accord-

their course] before the Pentecost. For behold, the sabbath

must either be some fault in the printer‚ or a riddle to 1110
that I cannot tell what to make of.

However‚ by the whole series of the discourse it appears,
that the beginning of the double circulation of the eourses
was with the twofold beginning of the year, Nisan and Tisri :
as also that all the courses performed their ministry together
in the feasts. Here, indeed, is mention only as to the Pass-
over3 but we do not want for authorities to make it out, that
as they did so then, so also at the feast of Pentecost and
Tabernacles. Let J ehoiarib, therefore, begin the first course
in the beginning of the month Nisan 3 and (remembering, that
all the courses together performed their service at the Pass-
