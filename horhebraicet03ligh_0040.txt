And now, after this survey of lands and regions, what could
be wanting to the full knowledge of the empire, but a strict
account of the people, their patrimony, and estates? and this
was Augustus's care to do.

“ RecepitP et morum legumque regimen aeque perpetuum‚''
&a ‘⁶ He took upon him the governxnent both of their man-
ners and laws, and both perpetual: by which right, though
without the title of censor, he laid a tax upon the people three
times3 the first and third with his colleague, the second
alone.'' The first with his colleague, M. Agrippa3 the third,
with his colleague Tiberius3 the second, by himself alone3 and
this was the tax our evangelist makes mention of in this place.

Ver. 2‘1: Αὕτη ἡ ἀπογραφὴ πρώτη ἐγένετο, &Q This taminy
wasfirst made, ‹8⁸0] Not the first taxing under Augustus, but
the first that was made under Oyrenius: for there was an-¹
other taxing under him, upon the occasion of which the sedi-
tion was raised by J udas the Gaulonite. Of this tax of ours,
Dion Cassius‘ seems to make mention, the times agreeing
well enough, though the agreement in other things is more
hardly reducible :—

Αὐτὸς δὲ ἀπογραφὰς τῶν ἐν τῇ Ἰταλίᾳ κατοικούντων, 8250. “ ΗΘ
began a tax upon those that dwelt in Italy, and were worth
two hundred sesterces3 sparing the poorer sort, and those
that lived beyond the countries of Italy, to avoid tumults.”

If those that lived out of Italy were not taxed, how does
this agree with the tax which our evangelist speaks of ἓ
unless you will distinguish‚ that in one sense they were not
taxed, that is, as to their estates they were not to pay any
thing: but in another sense they were, that is, as to taking
account of their names, that they might swear their allegiance
and subjection to the Roman empire. As to this, let the
more learned judge.
