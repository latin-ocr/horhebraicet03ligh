much used by the J ewish writers; and what they mean by
it we may gather from such passages as these : “ W hena God
was about to make Hezekiah the Messiah, mlffiffi’i ἻΨ nm&
saith the prime of the world to him, ‘ Ο eternal Lord, perform
the desire of this just one.''' Where this Gloss is; ‘⁶ The
prime <gf this world is the angel into whose hands the whole
world is delivered.'’

Who this should be, the masters tell outb: “ W'hen the

very peculiar notion, as I have shewn in that place.

They conceive it to be Samuel that deceived Eve. 'So the
Targumist before. And so Pirke R. Eliezer .· “ Theg serpent,
