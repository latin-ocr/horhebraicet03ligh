shall see me, because Ι go to the Father;'' i.e. “Ye shall not
see me personally, but virtually.” It is true, they did not sec
him when he lay in the grave; and they did see him when he
rose again: but I question whether these words ought to be
taken in this sense, because it would sound somewhat harshly
here what is added, “ Ye shall see me, because I go to the
Father.'' I would therefore rather understand it of his as-
cending into heaven; after which they saw him, indeed, no
more personally‚ but they did see him in the influences and
gift of his Holy Spirit. And so what follows agrees well
enough with this sense of the words, ver. 23; ‘⁶ In that day
ye shall ask me nothing” [as ye were now about to inquire of
me, ver. 19]: “ ask the Father in my name3 and he shall re-
veal to you whatever you shall ask of l1i1n.”

Ver. 24: θἘως ἄρτι οὐκ ᾐτήσατε οὐδὲν ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου·
Hitherto have ye asked nothiny in my omma] U nderstand this
clause of the extraordinary gifts of the spirit, and then all
things will be easy. All the faithful did pray in the name of
the Messial13 and these disciples‚ acknowledging J esus to be
the Messiah, did pray in the name of Jesus the Messiah.
But hitherto they had asketl nothiny extraordinary in his name .-
not the power of working miracles; not the revelation of
mysteries and of future things3 not the spirit of prophecy‚
&az forp it· was not necessary for them, as yet, to ask these
things in his name whilst he was present with them, who
could dispense it to them according to their instant neces-
sities ; but for the future, when himself should be gone from
them, whatsoever they should ask the Father in his name, he
would give it them. That prayer of the apostle's, Acts iv,
29, 30, is a good comment upon these words: “Ask such
things as these in my name3 and whatsoever you ask you
shall receive, that your joy may be full, when you shall find
by experience that I am still present with you when gone
from you.'’

Those things which both here and elsewhere in the dis-
courses of our Saviour might give occasion for scholastical
discussion, I leave wholly to the schools, omitting many pas-
sages about which a great deal might be said, because they
have been already the labours of other pens It was my de-
