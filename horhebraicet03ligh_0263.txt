Persia; or those seven weeks mentioned Dan. ix. 2 5, in
which Jerusalem was to be built, ⁴⁶ even in troublous times.'’
For whoever reckons by the kings of Persia, he must neces-
sarily attribute at least thirty years to Cyrus; which they
willingly do that are fond of this account: which thirty years
too, if they do not reckon to him after the time that he had
taken Babylon, and subverted that monarchy, they prove
nothing as to this computation at all.

“ CyrusP destroyed the empire of the Medes, and reigned
over Persia, having overthrown Astyages, the king of the
Medes:'' and from thence Eusebius reckons to Cyrus thirty
years. But by what authority he ascribes the J ews' being
set at liberty from their captivity to that very same year, I
cannot tell. For Cyrus could not release the Jews from
their captivity in Babylon before he had conquered Babylon
for himself ; and this was a great while after he had subdued
the Medes‚ as appears from all that have treated upon the
subversion of that empire: which how they agree with Xeno-
phon, I shall not inquire at this time: content at present
with this, that it doth not appear amongst any historians
that have committed the acts of Cyrus to memory, that they
have given thirty or twenty, no, not ten years to him after he
had taken Babylon. Leunclaviusq gives him but eight years3
and Xenophon himself seems to have given him but seven.
So that this account of forty-and-six years falls plainly to the
ground, as not being able to stand, but with the whole thirty
years of Cyrus included into the number.

Their opinion is more probable who make these forty-and-
six years parallel with the seven weeks in Dan. ix. 2 5. But
the building of the Temple ceased for more years than wherein
it was built3 and, in truth, if we compute the times wherein
any work was done upon the Temple, it was really built within
the space of ten years.

ΙΙ. This number of forty-six years fits well enough with
Herod's Temple3 for J osephusr tells us, that Herod began
the work in tlte eiyhteenth, year of lais Μέρη ‚· nor does he con-
tradict himself When heS tells us, Πεντεκαιδεδάτῳ γοῦν ἔτει τῆς
