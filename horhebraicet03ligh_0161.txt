(Jh. xv. 7.] Eum-citatione copon St. Lake. 155

puts me in mind of that of the apostle0‚ πνεύμασι δικαίων
τετελειωμένων, the spirits of just men made perfect. Where (if
I understand aright the scope of the apostle in the argument
he is upon) he speaks of ,just men who are still in this life,
and shews that the souls and spirits of believers are made
perfectly righteous by faith, contrary to what the Jews held,
that men were complete in their righteousness by works, even
bodily works.

Seeing those whom they accounted pfflfec‘tly just are termed
rrwym '³127th men ofworks,· so that perfbctlyy'ust and men of
work-5 were convertible ternis, it may not be improbable thatd
the Essenes or Essaei may have their name from Πζζᾉγῃς
so that they might be called mmm), that is, workers, and by
that be distinguished from the penitents. But of that matter
Ι will raise no dispute.

ΙΙΙ. Now which of these had the preference, whether per-
fect righteousness to repentance, or repentance to perfect
righteousness, it is not easy to discern at first· view, because
even amongst themselves there are different opinions about it.
We have a disputation in Beracoth, in the place newly cited,
in these wordse: “ R. Chaiah Bar Abba saith, R. J ochanan
saith, All the prophets did not prophesy, ΠΞἹΨΠ 47593ζῖ NS&
unless for those that repent. [raim ΕῬΡἿἻΞ ³:⁹2& AS for
those that are perfectlgy just, eye hath not seen besides thee, O
God f. But R. Abhu contradicts this: for R. Abhu saith.
The penitent do not stand in the place where the perfectly
just stand; as it is said& Peace, peace to him that is far off,

and to him that is near. ΞἾἾβῖὩ vm &wia PW'NS He
names kim, that is far qff'flrst, and then him that is niylz. But.
R. J ochanan, Who is he that is far off ἔ He that was far off

from transgressing ΝἾΡἾΠΞ from his first ori-qiud. And who
is he that is nigh? He that was next to transgression, but

now is afar off from it.''

These passages of the Talmud are quoted by Kimchi upon
Isa. lvii. 19; and⁷ out of him, by Drusius upon this placeh ;
but as far as I can perceive, very far wide from the mind of
Kimchi. For thus Drusius hath it 3 “ R. David Isa. lvii. 19,
