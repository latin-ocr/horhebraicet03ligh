clean on the outside, yet in the inside they might be clean3
and it was sufficient to the Pharisee, if he cleansed them on
the outside only. But the vessels here mentioned (if the

the inside indifferently. Some of them are recited by the Ge-
marists, viz. sacks, wallets, nightcapse‚ pillowcases‚ διο.

Our Saviour, therefore, does not herespeak according to
the letter, neither here nor in Matt. xxiii. 2 5, when he saith,
“ Ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter ;''
but by way of parable and similitude. ‘ You, while you are
so very nice and officious in your external washings, you
do nothing more than if you only washed the outside of the
cup or dish, while there was nothing but filth and nastiness
within.> ἢ

Ver. 40: ’Ἃφρονες- Y e fiola] numu* a word very common
to the nation. ‘⁶ Rabbanh J ochanan Ben Zacchai said to the

Ver. 41J' : Πλὴν τὰ ἐνόντα δότε ἐλεημοσύνην· But rather give
alms of such thiozys as με have] This seems ironically
spoken, and in derision to the opinion they had concerning
alms.

1. As to the version of the word τὰ ἐνόντα, may we not
suppose it signifies not only, quod superest, that which is over
and above, as the Vulgar, but also quod penes vos est, all that
you have, as Beza: or not only something that may have
respect to the riches of this world, but something also that
may have respect to the doctrines and tenets of the Phari-
sees. As if the meaning was this, “ ⁶ Those things which are
amongst you,' i. e. which obtain commonly amongst you, arc
