420 Hebrew mad Talmudz'cal [Ch. xviii. 21, 28.

If when it came to the month Nisan the barley was not yet
ripe enough to offer the sheaf of the first fruits, then they
put a month between, which they called the second Adar.
So if the ways were so bad that people could not· travel up to
Jerusalem, if the bridges were so broken that they could not
pass the rivers, they intercalated or put a month between,
that at the coming in of the month Nisan every thing might
be ready that was requisite for the Pascha} solemnity. But if
frost or snow should happen when Nisan was entering in its
ordinary course, they did not put a month between upon that
account. From whence it is plain that frost and snow did some-
times happen at that time.

Ver. 21 : Ἐπερώτησον τοὺς ἀκηκοότας· Ask them which heard
ma] Does not Jesus here appeal to the common right and
rule amongst themselves? viZ. that the witnesses in behalf of
the defendant might be heard first. But who, alas! was
there that durst witness for him? It is said, indeed, that
“ the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false
witness ayainst him? Matt. xxvi. 59. But did they seek any
true witnesss χόν him? or did they indeed deal with the wit-
nesses against him as their customs obliged them to have
done? did they search their testimony by a strict and severe
examinatione disc they terrzjfy them ΓΌἯΝὩ, or by grave ex-
hortations admonish them to say nothing but the truth3 This
by right ought to have been dones: but we have reason to
suppose it was not done.

Ver. 28: Ἀλλ’ ἵνα φάγωσι τὸ πάσχα· But that they mae'yltt
eat the Passover.] Ι. ΧΥΘ have already shewn, in our notes
upon Mark xiv. 12, that the eating of the Paschal lamb was
never, upon any occasion whatever, transferred from the
evening of the fourteenth day, drawing to the close of it ; no,
not by reason of the sabbath, or any uncleanness that had
happened to the congregation ς so that there needs little
argument to assure us that the Jews ate the lamb at the
same time wherein Christ did. Only let me add this: sup-
pose they had entered Pilate's house, and had defiled them-
selves by entering the house of a heathen‚ yet might not that
defilement come under the predicament of ΕἾἾ ³752&st If so,
then they might wash themselves in the evening, and be clean
