I do not say that all these met at this time in Bethlehem :
[It is indeed remarked of J oseph‚ that he was ‘⁶ of the house
of David ;'' partly because he was to be reputed, though he
was not the real father of Christ ; and partly also, that the oc-
casion might be related that brought Mary to Bethlehem,
where the Messiah was to be born.] But it may be con-
sidered whether Oyrenius, being now to take an estimate of
the people‚ might not, on purpose and out of policy⁷ summon
together all that were of David's stock, from whence he might
have heard the Jews' Messiah was to spring, to judge whether
some danger might not arise from thence.

Ver. 7 : Οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς τόπος ἐν τῷ καταλύματι· There ‘evas no
roomfor· them in elce *in-m] From hence it appears, that neither
J oseph nor his father Jacob had any house of their own here,
no, nor Eli neither, wherein to entertain his daughter Mary
ready to lie in. And yet we find that two years after the
birth of Christ, J oseph and Mary his wife lived in a hired
house till they fled into Egypt.

He shall deserve many thanks that will but tell us what
this Biratlc Arba is. The Gloss tells us no other than
that this “Biratk Arba was a place in Bethlehem ;” which
any one knows from the words themselves. But what, or
what kind of place was it? ΠἾἮ Bima indeed is a palaoe or
castle: but what should &2537 Arba be? A man had better
hold his tongue than conjecture vainly and to no purpose:
otherwise‚I might quote thatin Sozam, ΝΞἾῺἾ ἃἎἾῃἾ Νῗῃῃ :
which speaks concerning a promise or a surety for the per-
formance of the law. But I forbear.
