236 EPISTLE DEDICATORY.

your worth, and indeed of my own undertaking ,· the thin and
slender product of a plentiful watering, aiming at great things but
trifling in the performance.

Ι took, Ι confess, a high ssight, when Ι attempted the explication
of this evangelist, but how weak and languid Ι have proved,
(besides that the thing itself speaks sufficiently,) there shall be none
readier to accuse, than Ι to condemn myself. Let then the reader
spare his censure, for I will load myself with a shameful acknow—
ledgment, that Ι have adventured in things too high for me: and

when he sees this, perhaps he will forgive me undertaking so diffi- *

cult a task, wherein my design hath been only to be useful: nay,
perhaps pity me if I cannot indeed attain at what Ι would, But if
he will neither forgive nor pity, but still carp and censure me, let
him make the experiment upon this evangelist himself, and see if
he also may not step as short as Ι have done.

My lord, I have this comfort however, that I have not been idle ε
Ι had rather puzzle myself with hard and knotty inquiries, than
wear out my time in either doing nothing or trivially. Nor can I
reproach myself that I have made this research into this sacred
volume through unwarrantable curiosity, but out of humble sincere
zeal of mind, both to learn what Ι can myself, and teach others 3
offering, Ι hope, nothing that is noxious, and sometimes that that
may profit.

But, my lord, that which is my principal encouragement is, the
patronage and candour of so great a man, who I cannot but hope
will accept this small trifling qzfl with a gentle and easy aspect, from
the frequent experiment I have already made. But Ι must recall
that rash word 9²:1⁴⁶> when all that Ι can offer to your lordship is
absolute debt : and alas 1 how poor a paymaster does your lordship
find of me ! A few sorry scribblings for great and substantial kind-
nesses not to be reckoned up. Yet such they are, that bring along
with them all the returns of thanks that I am able to make. And
since I have nothing else, may the great God of heaven, of his infi-
nite goodness and bounty, reward you with all manner of felicity,
temporal and eternal : which he from his heart wishes and makes
it his daily prayer, who is,

My Lord,
Your Lordship’s most humble,

most obliged, and faithful servant,

JOHN LIGHTFOOT.
