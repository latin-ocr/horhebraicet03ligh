which is mentionedn: “ The Rabbins have a traditiono: From
the days of Moses to Rabban Gamaliel's, they were instructed
in the law standing. But when Rabban Gamaliel died, the
world languished, so that they learned the law sitting. '³
Whence also that tradition, that, ‘⁸ since the death of Rabban

upon. The great Hillel possessed the seat at this time; or
if he was newly dead, his son Simeon succeeded him: so that
it was the disciples’ part in this age to stand, not to sit in the
presence of their doctors. How therefore should it be said
of Christ, that he was “ sitting among the doctors 3” Let the
following clause solve the difficulty :
