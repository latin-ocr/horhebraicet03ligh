The Rabbins (as we have already observed upon chap.v. 3 5)
distinguish their winter months into ῆἾΠ and ’ΠΡ winter and
mid-winter: intimating, as it should seem, the more remiss

Shebat was ῆἾΠ the winter. Ten days therefore of the winter

was the Messiam or that they rather feared he was so? It
seems, they rather feared than hoped it. For whereas they
looked for a Messias that should prove a mighty conqueror,
should deliver the people from the heathen yoke, and should
crown himself with all earthly glory; and saw Jesus infinite
degrees below such pomp 3 yet by his miracles giving such
fair specimens of the Messia83 they could not but hang i'n
great suspense, whether such a Mcssiah were to be wished
for or no.
