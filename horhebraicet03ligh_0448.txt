but only because the Pelusiotes and Pelusium were com-
monly so termed by the J ews? Who could have imagined
any reason why they should say of Eli, that ἔκρινε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ
εἴκοσι ἔτη, lzejndyed Israel ‘ twenty' yearS, when in the original
it is sowy, 1 Sam. iv. 18, but that they favoured the common
figment of that nation, that the Philistines had such a dread
of Samson, that for twenty years after his death they stood
in as much awe of him as if he was then alive and judged
Israel? Of this nature is their rendering Ἶξ son by παιδεία,
instruction, (Psahn ii. 12). And upon some such account, no
doubt, is this κατωρχήσαυτο in the place we are now treating

think that κατωρχήσαντο was the very word which the inter-
preters 'themselves did use; which rendering our evangelist
deservedly rejects.

Think you that figment about Messiah Ben Joseph (to
which the Tahnudists¹ apply these words of Zechariah, as
also doth Aben Ezra upon the place) was invented when the
Greek version was first framed ἓ If not, which is my opinion,
then it is probable that the Chaldee paraphrast gave the
sense that most obtained in the nation at that time, with
which that of the Greek accords well enough. The inter-
preters rendering it according to the common opinion of the
nation, read, as it seems, ²¹79] for *NV-J 3 for it is a thing
not unusual with them to be purblind either in earnest or
