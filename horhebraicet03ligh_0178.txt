amongst the J exve, we may gather from what is spoken os
the manners and the death of this R. Judah3 concerning
whom it is said, ΒΠἻΞΝ LKZ* '237'172 :xvv ΞἾἾΠ This day lae
sits in A braham’s bosomss'. “ Rabbi Judah had the toothache
thirteen years; and in all that time there was not an abortive
woman throughout the whole land of Israel.'' For to him it
is that they apply those words of the prophet, “ Hef was a
man of sorrows, and hath borne our griefs.” And for these
very pains of his, some had almost persuaded themselves that
he was the Messiah. At length this toothache was relieved
by Elias, appear-ing in the likeness of R. Chaijah Rubbah,
who, by touching his tooth, cured him. When he died, and

all scruple and hesitancy understand it, that he was in the
very embraces of Abraham, (as they were wont at table one to
lie in the other's bosom‚) in the exquisite delights and perfect
felicities osparadise? not in ‘ a lake without water} ‘a prison,'
‘ the very brink of hell.'

ary‚ take another parable: “ Thereh are wieked men that are
coupled together in this world. But one of them repents
before death; the other dot-h not : so the one is found stand-

the wicked. The one seeth the other, [this agrees with the
passage now before uS,] and saith, ‘ Woe l and alas! here is
