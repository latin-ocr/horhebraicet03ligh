“ Theyo begin on the defendant’s side. One of the witnesses
saith, ΠἸΣΠ ἹἾῖᾍ) *vr-³5³7 ⁸¹7 127³, I have something] to says in leis
clefence. If any of his disciples say, ⁶ I have wherewith to ac-

ciple say, ‘ I can offer something in his defence‚' they call him
up and place him among themselves, and suffer him not to go
down thence the whole day after.''

Did they thus proceed with our Saviour? did they endea-
vour first for the clearing his innocency? and were there
any witnesses produced for this purpose? If SO‚ then here
were ‘Peter and that other disciple‚’ who could have wit-
nessed in his behalf: but Peter denies that he ever knew
him.

Ver. 181³: “Orc ψύχος ἣν· For it was coleh] It was the very
dead of night, almost at cockcrowing. Our countryman
Biddulphq, who was at Jerusalem at the very time when they
were wont to celebrate the Passover‚ gives us the reason of
this cold by his own experience. He acknowledgeth indeed
that he found it so hot at that time as we usually feel it in
our own country about midsummer, that he could not but
wonder how Peter, at that time of the year, should be so
, cold. But within a few days his doubt was resolved, for there
were mighty dews fell, which not being wholly dried up by the
sun made it very cold, especially in the night, &c.

Nay, the traditional fathers suppose there may be frost and
snow in the time of Passover, by that canon of theirs3 “ Theyr
do not intercalate the year ,⁸3:217 *len &³7³ 237& ‘¹:572 ΝΒ
eitherfor snow or for fl²ost.''

The intercalation of the year respeeted chiefly the Paschal
solemnity3 namely, that by the interposing of the interca-
lated month all things might be ripe and fit for that feast.
