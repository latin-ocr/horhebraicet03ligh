in those Psalms that conclude any portion of that book, and
end with Ameng .· upon what subject soever the Psalmist is
engaged, either throughout the whole psalm, or immediately
before the bringing forth of Amen, still he never doth mention
Amen without some foregoingh doxology and benediction,
“Blessed be the Lord God, &Q Amen and Amen.” In
St. Matthew, therefore, we find Amen, because there is the
doxology: in St. Luke it is wanting, because the doxology is
so too. You may see more of this in notes upon Matt. vi.

Ver. 15: Ἐν Βεελζεβοὺλ ἄρχοντι τῶν δαιμονίων· T brou-qh,
Beelzebub the chief qf tlze clevile] Ι. As to this name of Beel-
zebub I have elsewherei discoursed, and do still assert the
reading of it with the letter l in the end of it, viz. Beelzebul,
against the Syriae, Persian, Vulgar‚ and other translations,
which read it Beelzebub. The Italian, cautiously indeed,
but not purely, Beelwbu, that he might not strike upon
either the one or the other reading: but in the mean time
I will not answer for the faithfulness and candour of the
interpreter.

II. Amongst the Jews we may observe three devils called
the chief, 01¹ prince qs the devils: 1. ‘The angel of death ς’
who is called numm-i ³7: 127&ss Princek ῳ( all the Samus.
2· pumma N‘T'w tlte devil Asmodeus: of him afterward.
3. Beelzebub, in this place. Now as to vindicating the writing
of it by l in the end of the word, and not b:

ΙΙΙ. It is a question whether there were such a thing as
Beelzebub in rerum uatum. Why should not the deity of
the place take his farewell, when Ekron, the place of this
deity, was wholly obliterated? When there was no more an
idol nor oracle at Ekron, did not the demon cease to be
Beelzebub any longer, although it did not cease to be a
demon? Wherever, therefore, Ekron was under the second
Temple, or the place where it had been under the first3 you
can hardly persuade me there was any idol or oracle of
Beelzebub, and so not Beelzebub himself. I will not here
dispute whether Achor, the Cyrenians' tutelar god against
fliesl‚ hath any relation or affinity with the name of Ekron.
