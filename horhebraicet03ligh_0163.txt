IV. After all this, therefore, judge whether Christ spoke
simply or directly of any such persons (as if there were really
any such) that could need 720 repentaneffl or rather, whether
he did not at that time utter himself according to the com—
mon conceptions that nation had about some jaetjf'eetly sats?
persons, which he himself opposed. And this seems so much
the more likely by how much he saith, ‘· I say uuto you,'’ as
if he set himself against that common conceit of theirs : and
that example he brings of a certain person that needed w)
repentance, viz„ the prodigal's brother, savours rather of the
Jewish doctrine than that he supposed any one in this world
perfectly just.

Ver. 11 : Ἄνθρωπός n} εἶχε δύο υἱούς· Α certain ‘mem had
two sons] It is no new thing so to apply this parable‚ as if
the elder son denoted the Jew, and the younger the Gentile.
And, indeed, the elder son doth suit well enough ‘with the
,J ew in this, that he boasts so much of his obedience, ‘²' Ι have
not transgressed at any time thy connnandment :⁹⁶ as also,
that he is so much against the entertainment of his bro-
