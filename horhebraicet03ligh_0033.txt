Lord), We are orphans, bereaved of our father: such a one
shall your Redeemer be, whom I shall give you.’ So upon
Zechariah, “ Behold my servant, whose name is Branch :⁵⁸
and out of Psalm cX, ‘⁶ Thou art a priest after the order of
Melchizedek :⁹⁹ he saith, R. Berachiah delivers the same
things. And R. Simeon Ben Jochai upon Genesis more
plainly3 viz. ‘⁴ That the Spirit, by the impulse of a mighty
power, shall come forth of the womb, though shut up, that
will become a mighty Prince, the King Messiah.'’—-So he.

Ver. 36 : Συνειληφυῖα υἱὸν ἐν γήρᾳ αὐτῆς· Haila also Conoci‘ved
a son in her 0ch aya] The angel teaches to what purpose it
was that women, either barren before or considerably stricken
in years, should be enabled to conceive and bring f01·tl1; viz.
to make way for the easier belief of the conception of a virgin.
If they, either beside or beyond nature, conceive a child, this
may be some ground of belief that a virgin, contrary to na-
ture, may do so too. So Abraham by fait-h saw Christ’s day,
as born of a pure virgin, in the birth of his own son Isaac of
his old and barren wife Sarah.

Ver. 39: Ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὴν ὀρεινὴν, &a She went into the
11111 country, εἷμα] That is, to Hebron, Josh. xxi. 11. For
though it is truc indeed that the priests after the return
from Babylon were not all disposed and placed in all those
very same dwellings they had possessed before the captivity,
yet it is probable that Zacharias, who was of the seed of
Aaron, being here said to dwell in the hill country ofJudak,
might have his house in Hebron, which is more peculiarly
said to be ‘ the city of Aaron's offspring.'

Ver. 41 z Ἐσκίρτησε· lee babo Zeaped in 11ον womb,] So the
Seventy‚ Gen. xxv. 22, Ἐσκίρτων τὰ παιδία ἐν αὐτῇ, the 01111-
dren Zeaped in laer womb. Psalm cxiv. 4, τὰ ὅρη ἐσκίρτησαν,
the mountaius skipped. That which is added by Elizabeth,
ver. 44, ἐσκίρτησεν ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει, the habe Zeaped in the womb
for joy, signifies the manner of the thing, not the cause: q. d.
it leaped with vehement multatim. For John, while he was
an embryo in the womb, knew no more what was then done,
than Jacob and Esau when they were in Rebekah's womb
knew what was determined concerning them.
